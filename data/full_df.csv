The whole problem with co-pilots is, can you work it in a way that goes in the doctor workflow where they view it as a benefit, not a nuisance. It's not some alert or whatever. It's like something where they are going to it. If you can do that, and maybe we've seen this with scribes and so on, something where doctors are like, hell yeah, I want this. This is great. If we can create that, and maybe that's the challenge and the call to arms for founders, create something, some product that people are clamoring for it. And that's obviously knowing that space really well and knowing your customers and knowing your people are going to use it.

Grand Challenges in Healthcare AI,a16z Podcast,a16z,https://share.snipd.com/episode/529394bf-5dc8-4fb4-8bff-aeb7b7cd472c,2024-09-07,2024-12-24T14:55,"Vijay Pande, founding general partner, and Julie Yoo, general partner at a16z Bio + Health, come together to discuss the grand challenges facing healthcare AI today. The talk through the implications of AI integration in healthcare workflows, AI as a potential catalyst for value-based care, and the opportunity for innovation in clinical trials. They also talk about the AI startup they each wish would walk through the door.","1. AI reflects the flaws of existing healthcare systems, with its effectiveness directly tied to the human-written rules it automates, highlighting the need for systemic improvements.
2. Denial rates in healthcare are influenced by the speed of AI executing flawed processes, rather than the technology itself, emphasizing the importance of redesigning business models.
3. To improve healthcare workflows for professionals, new tools must be integrated seamlessly into existing systems like electronic health records to enhance adoption and reduce burden.
4. Startups should focus on creating AI-driven products that resonate with healthcare providers, taking into account their insights and the industry's demands to encourage widespread use.
5. AI has considerable potential in enhancing clinical trials, where even small improvements can lead to significant financial benefits, drawing parallels to optimization successes in advertising.
6. There is a unique opportunity to design AI-native health plans that rethink payment mechanisms and risk underwriting, aiming for personalization rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",36:44,The Potential of AI in Clinical Trials and Health Plans,https://share.snipd.com/snip/c03740a4-647e-4e2a-9dff-34db0140d406,3min,34:51 - 37:36,"AI holds significant potential to enhance clinical trials, which are crucial to healthcare and involve substantial financial investments. A mere 5-10% improvement in clinical trials could lead to substantial monetary benefits. Additionally, there's a unique opportunity to develop an AI-native health plan that fundamentally rethinks payment mechanisms, risk underwriting, and patient-provider networks.","One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit. I remember a decade or so ago, I have a acquaintance who was working for Google and they were optimizing various filters and this and that. They made it 5x better, one of the ad filters. And basically 5x was $100 million. A 5% was $100 million. And so I may be really jealous. I'm working on something in drug design or whatever to make big leaps and bounds. And small things for big cash flows can have a huge impact.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI.

And, and, but when we, they wouldn't tell us who the meeting place was until we landed. And then they gave us an address. When we got there, we were searched. Our car was searched because they were worried about somebody trying to kill Jeff. And I was thinking to myself, I would never want to be so rich and so famous and so powerful that I couldn't live a normal life, that I didn't have any anonymity. That was like a real wake-up call. It's like, I'm sure Jeff's one of the most envied people in the world, but I would not want to have to live my life like that. So a little bit of fame, a little bit of money, a little bit of power to a certain point is gratifying to the soul. But past that point, you get diminishing returns. It's no longer bringing you any kind of happiness. It's now a burden. So I got clear about death at a pretty young age and I just wanted to accomplish things. And I didn't think my accomplishments were that big a deal. Other people are accomplishing stuff as well. So I didn't spend a lot of time comparing myself to others, either people that had less or had more. I was too busy creating the next painting because that was what was fun. That was what was exciting. That was where the joy and the love came. And then the relationships with the people that you're doing it with.

What do you mean by that? You're talking about the incentives of the insurance companies? Say you're sitting at United or Humana or a Blue Cross and Blue Shield. You have a person, call them 30 years old, who you're insuring. You're going to spend money today for them, and the payoff's going to dribble out in five, six, seven years when they've gone for a long time with their diabetes under control or they've Gone for a long time ceasing to be obese. The problem is by the time those positive benefits come and the cost savings come, they're no longer being insured by you. We call this in the medical health policy world churn. The churn is so much in the insurance market that that investment horizon for companies is not five, six, seven years. It tends to be one year and maximum two years. Is that primarily because health insurance is tied to employment in this country? That's a large reason for it. People change jobs, lose jobs, move. They get married and they switch from their insurance to their spouse's insurance. We've created a system that perfectly disincentivizes long-term investments. And that's bad when chronic illness is the main source of costs. So we're going to have to change how we structure the insurance marketplace. And no one's talking about that at the moment.",

While legal services cannot afford mistakes due to their high stakes, customer support can leverage AI, starting from basic queries at level one and gradually moving to more complex issues. The existing tiered structure in customer support allows for effective integration of large language models (LLMs), as they can take on initial inquiries and escalate them as necessary. The improving accuracy of AI models, particularly those with advanced reasoning capabilities, suggests a readiness for adoption in environments where precision is less critical, indicating a transformative impact on many jobs in the sector.","Well, I think sales will be the one that's disrupted after customer support. I don't know. I think it's gonna be very disruptive. One of the reasons I think this is, you know, in the early days of LLMs, people were saying that legal services would be disrupted. And you saw some very highly valued startups rocketing up based on that. I think the problem with that is the error rate. So when you think about AI applications, you have to think about what is the tolerable error rate that the industry will allow. Because we know that AIs get things wrong, they can hallucinate, and you're never gonna be able to make it perfect. I mean, you can improve the quality, but it's still gonna have some errors. And when you're dealing with like legal services, for example, you just can't have mistakes. This is not tolerated. However, customer support is different. Customer support is already organized into levels, level one, level two, level three, based on difficulty. And there's already, in a sense, a mechanism for failover. If the level one customer support person can't answer the question, they kick it up to level two. So there's a place for LLMs to start in Customer Support, which is replacing all the level one and then working their way up the chain to level two as they get better and better. And so what I'm saying is that the level of accuracy now, especially with the new PhD level reasoning models is good enough. Yeah. We don't need to wait for like some perfect LLM model. And I think this is why this is going to be a big, big disruption. Let me tell you this.

This data can effectively train AI models, making it less sensitive compared to proprietary information like medical or legal records. Despite the potential for rapid advancements in foundation models, which may lead to high valuations for startups pursuing customer support innovations, the ease of accessibility and implementation of these models poses a significant risk of commoditization. This trend could permit smaller teams to leverage next-generation models quickly, undermining the sustainability of the business value created by current customer support solutions. Focusing on more regulated sectors that require specialized customization is essential, as these areas have a lower tolerance for error and present higher barriers to entry, fostering a competitive advantage that is less likely to be commoditized.","One of the reasons why I'm bullish on this customer support use case is because there's a very large data set to train on You've got all of the product documentation that companies very Created.

And there are a set of encryption standards that are called post-quantum encryption.</blockquote>"

Apple, however, lacks both, leading to a suboptimal user experience, as there's no system in place to catch and correct issues.","Yeah. Let me, let me pause, double click on that for a second. So I think taste is great if you have it, but there's only so many people on the planet that are going to have, you know, cutting edge taste and be right.

Because Apple has the antibodies to using data to measure success with the user experience, measure whatever success.

So, you know, historians, they go to university to study for at least 10 years before they become professional historians.

Fiction, on the other hand, is very cheap. You just write the first thing that comes to your mind. The truth is also very complicated, or often it's complicated because reality is complicated. Whereas fiction can make it as simple as you would like it to be. And people tend to prefer, in most cases, simplicity over complexity.","<b>Yuval Noah Harari</b><br/><br/>If you want to write or to produce a truthful account of something, of the Roman Empire, of the economic crisis, whatever, you need to invest a lot of time and effort and money in looking For evidence and fact-checking and analyzing. ... and complexity."

As a result, scientists and engineers may develop powerful technologies, but it is the ideologues who ultimately determine how these technologies are applied, highlighting a disconnect where knowledge is often overshadowed by the authority of ideological experts.","You usually convince millions of people to work on a project together by telling them some ideology or some mythology. And here, the facts don't matter so much. If you try to build a very powerful ideology and you ignore the facts, your ideology is still likely to explode with a very, very big bang.

Conservation initiatives, including strategic fencing projects and wildlife management programs, are racing to protect this remarkable organism, whose preservation represents not just saving a single entity, but protecting a complex ecosystem that supports hundreds of dependent species and provides crucial insights into forest resilience and adaptation.

Deutschland gilt als führend im ethischen Kapitalismus, teilweise aufgrund der Nachkriegsordnung und der sozialen Marktwirtschaft. Den deutschen Wirtschaftsvordenkern, oft im Widerstand gegen Hitler aktiv, lag bereits ein ethisches Verständnis von freier Wirtschaft zugrunde.

Aber das ist in der Tat die Struktur. Ob das jetzt 3D-Drucker in München sind, da habe ich gerade interessante Persönlichkeiten kennengelernt. Das ist ja auch eine starke Szene in Deutschland. Oder egal, wo man in Deutschland hinschaut, sitzt da in der Tat die Möglichkeit des ethischen Kapitalismus. Und das heißt, wir sind eine führende Nation in dieser Angelegenheit oder ist das schon wieder zu arrogant gedacht, Deutschland als führende Nation des ethischen Kapitalismus versus Des US-Kapitalismus, der sich selber oligarchisiert? Ich glaube, wir sind zufällig führend, weil wir das Glück im Unglück hatten, dass die Nachkriegsordnung uns die soziale Marktwirtschaft abgenötigt hat, strukturell. Das liegt natürlich auch daran, dass die relevanten Vordenker und Vordenkerinnen der Bundesrepublik, die Wirtschaftsvordenker, die Ordoliberalen und so weiter, kämpfen ja schon Während des Zweiten Weltkrieges, waren die ja im Widerstand. Das vergessen heute die, die gerne den Neoliberalismus kritisieren, dass diese Leute im Widerstand gegen Hitler sich ihre Gedanken gemacht haben über eine freie Wirtschaft, wie Dem auch sei. Im Widerstand gegen einen Staatskapitalismus, wenn man so will. Genau, von vornherein gab es da einen ethischen Aufruf. Das findet man aber woanders auch, sehr stark in der Schweiz, wo das auch ein sehr gut funktionierendes System ist, vor allen Dingen aber auch in Japan. Ich würde denken, Japan könnte für uns jetzt ein interessanter Kooperationspartner auf Augenhöhe sein, weil man dort natürlich auch die großen Familiennamen hat.

But what it has done clearly by putting Elon and Vivek in charge is that these great marketing tools for attracting talent, because I think previously one of our biggest issues in America Has been that it's not cool to work for the government.

And that tweet, you know, the way that they're sort of making it exciting that we're going to be cutting costs in an unglamorous way, but we need the smartest people in America to help Us do it. That, to me, is the right direction. And if using Elon and Vivek are the ways to do it, I'm actually all for it. I like that. I think that's really insightful. And you're absolutely right. We need to make government jobs aspirational. And if we can use two aspirations educational, you know, very successful men to create that aspiration around government work.

No, they just did that because they were trying to do the morally correct thing, because of the million people, something like 850,000 of them were men, and that really doesn't help The demographic situation in the long run. That's before you consider things like language and cultural and skills barriers. If the Germans really wanted to solve their demographic problem with immigration, they would need to bring in about 2 million people a year under age 25 every year from now on just to Hold the line. You know, after 20 years, it's not Germany anymore. If you're going to use immigration to stave off a demographic problem, you need to do two things. One, you need to start early before you have much of a problem. And two, you have to have some assimilative capacity so you don't generate big culture clashes.

This realignment signals the end of the Democratic Party as we know it, as minority groups and organized labor shift allegiances.","So number two, with political factions in motion, a new party is being born. Now, I can't tell you right now if the current alignment that brought Trump to power for his second term is a permanent feature of MAGA, and it is MAGA. This is not the Republican alliance. It's something new. But what I can say, it is the end of what we think of as the Democratic Party. Remember, minorities, organized labor, educated white coastal elites. Well, organized labor is now at best from the Democratic point of view, a swing vote. And over half of them did vote for Trump. But minorities is really where it's at. The fastest growing demographic in the country, largely due to immigration, is Hispanics. And Hispanics, people always seem to forget this. Hispanics are the group in the United States that are most opposed to migration in really any form. And so when Donald Trump made a lot of his pitch about the southern border, it really resonated with the people who at one point crossed. And organized labor out of the Democratic Alliance means that any places where those two pieces matter for local politics all of a sudden are, at best, up for grabs. And that means without some significant soul-searching and, more importantly, some significant alignment shifts, white coastal educated elites, that's not a party. That's a book club, and it can't win federal elections.",

We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems. She makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen — regardless of age or sex. She also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices.

These lies did not start on October 8th. They have been promulgated for decades. And it seems that no matter how patiently one corrects them, nothing changes.

It's also natural for people to look at the history of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and imagine that there's some moral parity between the two sides. In fact, because Israel has become more powerful, most people imagine that the responsibility for the ongoing conflict falls more on the Jews. Israel is now perceived to be a bully with advanced weaponry. And the Palestinians are merely victims throwing rocks.

In contrast, the political system tends to resist change, leading to a buildup of bureaucracy without the capacity for renewal. Instead of evolving, it grows larger and more complex, lacking the mechanisms for constructive reform.","Yeah, I mean, look, if we're talking about capitalism, I think about what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter said, which is capitalism is a process of creative destruction. And the creativity happens in the early days when you've got a founder who's creating a startup and the business gets big, but then it gets older and the founder goes away and the company Can drift and become bureaucratic. And sometimes it can renew itself. And maybe you get a Brian Nicolan maybe to save it, and sometimes it doesn't. And the companies that get old and don't renew themselves eventually fade away, and they get destroyed and replaced by other startups. It's a system that has worked incredibly well in America, and that's the basis for all of our prosperity and innovation. When you compare that to the political process, it's very different. I mean, the political process kind of has this knee-jerk resistance to change and innovation, and it has an impulse to control things. It wants to control prices. It thinks it can solve problems with just top-down mandates. And it doesn't reform itself. It creates new bureaucracies. It never gets rid of them. I mean, we create new departments. They never go away, they just keep getting bigger and bigger. There's never any creative destruction. It's just like a... It's a one-way ratchet of bureaucratic growth. So it's really clear what creates prosperity.

It emphasizes that capitalism thrives on continuous renewal through innovation, which older companies must adapt to or face obsolescence. The notes highlight the danger of bureaucratic growth impeding progress and the need for voters to advocate for substantial change to maintain economic dynamism. Listeners are cautioned about the bureaucratic ratchet effect, where resistant political processes expand without eliminating outdated structures. The episode encourages a critical choice for voters: support the reintegration of capitalist innovation or acquiesce to overwhelming government expansion that stifles economic progress. The contrast between capitalism and socialism is examined, underscoring the importance of effectively managing power and resource distribution in society.",01:33:00,Beware the Bureaucratic Ratchet,https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8db4a88-9a98-401f-a467-015bd15e94e7,1min,01:31:44 - 01:33:00,"The political process exhibits a resistance to change and innovation, driven by a compulsion to control through top-down mandates, which leads to the expansion of bureaucracies without the elimination of obsolete structures. This unchecked growth of government threatens the dynamics of creative destruction essential for prosperity. A crucial decision lies ahead for voters, where they must choose between reining in government expansion to foster capitalist innovation or allowing it to dominate and stifle economic progress.","When you compare that to the political process, it's very different. I mean, the political process kind of has this knee-jerk resistance to change and innovation, and it has an impulse to control things. It wants to control prices. It thinks it can solve problems with just top-down mandates. And it doesn't reform itself. It creates new bureaucracies. It never gets rid of them. I mean, we create new departments. They never go away, they just keep getting bigger and bigger. There's never any creative destruction. It's just like a... It's a one-way ratchet of bureaucratic growth. So it's really clear what creates prosperity. And I do think we have now reached a point where the government has gotten so big and so out of control and so expensive it actually is threatening this engine of creative destruction. And at some point, I think voters are going to have to make a choice about whether they're going to try and rein in the government and create more room for capitalism innovation, or they're Going to allow it to get overtaken.",<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b>...</blockquote>

But now I'm sitting on this phone, I'm seeing this funniest moment or this most beautiful person, or this incredible experience that I am not a part of, I am not in I don't get instant desire Creation for me.

So in order, they are no smartphone before high school. We have just cleared this all out middle school. Middle schoolers should not be having the internet in their pocket, give them a flip phone, give them a phone watch, give them something else, but not a smartphone. No social media till 16. Social media is wildly inappropriate for minors. It's full of extreme sex, violence, you know, men from all over the world reaching out to you because they want sex. I mean, it's insane that we have children talking with men all over the world. So no social media til 16. The third norm is phone free schools. Lock up the phones in a yonder pouch, or in a phone locker in the morning, they get it back at the end of the day. And the fourth norm is far more independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. Because until the 1990s, kids had a childhood, they were outside a lot, they had adventures, they to be self -governing, self -supervising. We took that away from them beginning in the 90s, totally gone by 2015. So our kids never get any fun or adventure. So all they have is their screens. So if we do those four things, we break out of these collective action problems.</blockquote></details>"

But basically, there's a liberal or progressive sentiment that says it's captured by this Robert F. Kennedy quote, some men see things as they are and say why I dream things that never were, and say why not? So progressives historically are the people who look at existing institutions and say, you know, why don't we change this? Like why don't we have some other thing, which might be more just? So progressives are always pushing for progress, for change. But then the wisdom of the right is to say, you know what, we may not understand our institutions, but if we just go changing them willy -nilly, it's going to be a disaster because we don't Understand what we're doing. In fact, I opened our conversation with that. That's actually a conservative, but one thing I learned from reading the conservative intellectuals, going back to Edmund Burke, you can't just go messing with institutions and Expect it to work out well. So a good liberal democracy, one in which you have some people pushing for change, you've got other people saying slow down, like not so fast, like let's be careful about this.</blockquote></details>"

Deutschland gilt wegen seiner schwachen Wirtschaft inzwischen als kranker Mann Europas. Doch was sind die Ursachen? Fehlt es an Investitionen oder an Innovationen, sind immer noch die Folgen der gestiegenen Energiepreise schuld oder vor allem der Fachkräftemangel? Welche Rolle spielt die Bürokratie und warum ist der Inflation Reduction Act der Biden-Regierung eigentlich so viel wirkungsvoller als der europäische Green Deal? All das analysiert im Gespräch mit Gabor Steingart ein Mann, der sich bestens auskennt mit der Wirtschaft: Joe Kaeser. Der hochkarätige Manager war unter anderem von 2006 bis 2013 Finanzvorstand der Siemens AG, danach Vorstandsvorsitzender des Konzerns. Für ein besseres Zusammenspiel zwischen Wirtschaft und Politik hat er konkrete Empfehlungen und schlägt ganz grundsätzliche strukturelle Veränderungen, ja eine regelrechte Staatsreform, vor: Eine Agenda 2030. Was er genau darunter versteht und wie das konkret aussehen könnte, erzählt er in dieser Sonderausgabe des Morning Briefings.",,03:38,Wirtschaft zuerst: Die Mittelherkunft für soziale Sicherung und Nachhaltigkeit,https://share.snipd.com/snip/f3300cb6-2017-491a-b5dd-244808e5a8c2,02:18 - 03:38,,"Die Marktwirtschaft und insbesondere die Wirtschaftsentwicklung sollten priorisiert werden, da die Einnahmen aus der Wirtschaft die Grundlage für soziale Sicherung und eine nachhaltige Wirtschaft bilden.

Speaker 1: Denke, dass die heutige Regierung, und man muss es auch glaube ich sagen, in den Spätzeiten der vorherigen, aus der sozialen Marktwirtschaft und dann jetzt aus der sozial -ökologischen Marktwirtschaft sozial sich ganz gut entwickelt hat, der Ökologie auch, wenn er vielleicht in Nuancen ideologisch, aber die Marktwirtschaft irgendwie zu kurz gekommen ist. Und ich denke, wir in Deutschland tun gut daran, uns nochmal darauf zu besinnen, dass die Wirtschaft, die Marktwirtschaft ja die Mittelherkunft an sich auch ist. Dass das, was dort verdient wird, was investiert wird, dann auch in die soziale Sicherung und natürlich auch in eine nachhaltige Wirtschaft hineingesteckt werden kann. Aber das ist die Reihenfolge. Man kann... Wirtschaft zuerst, sagen Sie. Ja, genau, weil man immer nur das ausgeben kann, was man vorher verdient hat. Die Steuern sind ein Substrat dessen. Die Steuern sind im Grunde ein Ausdruck der Mittelherkunft. Wenn es der Wirtschaft gut geht, dann gibt es viele Steuern. Und dann kann man auch viel investieren, aber auch eine gute soziale Sicherung betreiben. Aber die Reihenfolge ist im Augenblick nicht so. Wir reden über Sozialstaat und wie wir helfen können und helfen können und helfen können. Das ist an sich nicht schlecht. Wir werden die Welt nicht dadurch retten und auch Deutschland nicht, indem wir immer nur überall helfen."

Good leadership can lead to successful outcomes even with limited resources, opportunities, or historical challenges, while poor leadership can lead to failure.

Poland today is doing really well. Why is that? Because they joined the European Union, they've had to make huge changes and reforms, and therefore they're a successful country.

Technically, China's federal, but because of the purges and because of the control of the Communist Party, it has basically become super unitary where everything that happens in Beijing is the only thing that matters, because Xi has purged all of the regional local governments of anyone who has any capacity.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There is no successor.

Finding a middle ground with a confederal system has not been successful historically, leading to friction and conflict among regions.

And two -thirds of jobs now require a college degree. The highest - industries generally want someone with a college degree, and you do acquire certain skills and contacts in college. So women quite frankly deserve to be making more money than men. In urban metros in the United States, people under the age of 30, women are now, in most of those cities, making more money than the men, because they come more credentialed, more single Women owned homes than single men. This is a good thing. This is a good thing. And what we need to acknowledge though, is that this is gonna have a real impact on household formation. One, because men made social economically horizontally and down, women horizontally and up. And when the pool of horizontal and up gets smaller and smaller, it means more, or fewer and fewer young people are going to find a partner they find economically and emotionally viable.

And two -thirds of jobs now require a college degree. The highest - industries generally want someone with a college degree, and you do acquire certain skills and contacts in college. So women quite frankly deserve to be making more money than men. In urban metros in the United States, people under the age of 30, women are now, in most of those cities, making more money than the men, because they come more credentialed, more single Women owned homes than single men. This is a good thing. This is a good thing. And what we need to acknowledge though, is that this is gonna have a real impact on household formation. One, because men made social economically horizontally and down, women horizontally and up. And when the pool of horizontal and up gets smaller and smaller, it means more, or fewer and fewer young people are going to find a partner they find economically and emotionally viable. Women are gonna have a tougher time finding economically and emotionally viable men. And there's gonna be less household formation, lower birth rates, more loneliness.

At that point, didn't he control 30% of the Soviet Union? He'll never hold it. He'll choke on his acquisitions. Did Germany have the power under another leader to just hold that whole section of Eurasia? All right, I'm going to flip this whole argument. You're talking about people doing territorial conquests and taking things and butchering enormous numbers of people to get it. You can watch this in real time in Ukraine. This is how it goes. You're butchering a lot of people. You're destroying wealth at an incredibly rapid club. You can do that. But it's really wealth destroying. Since the Industrial Revolution in the West, there has been a growing consensus that that's probably not the way to do things. We are far better crafting international institutions, international laws, treaties that we sign on to, the parts that we want to, and then we adhere to them. And then that allows us to go all over the world running our little credit card transactions. No one kills us. And you can make a lot of wealth doing that.

The success of Russia after World War II prompts the question of why some countries perform exceptionally well economically.","Yeah. And that the compounding is a very important point, because I think Tyler Cowan is an example in one of his books that if US economic growth rates have been 1% lower every year from 1890 To basically the 20th century, they had been 1% lower each year. The US per capita, GDP would be lower than that of Mexico's. Bingo. And this is to give a tangential comment. This is how sanctions work. People look at sanctions and go, oh, they don't work because you don't make the whoever's annoying you change whatever they're doing.

These countries have experienced an improvement in living standards since being freed from Soviet domination. The hope was to integrate Russia into the Western world to improve their economy and governance. However, Russian standards of living have stagnated under Putin's model, which relies on taking over neighboring countries. It is crucial to prioritize the security of Eastern European countries and the broader implications on European geopolitics, especially in the context of deterrence against the threat of nuclear war.","I think people who are, you know, less empathetic to the Ukraine cause upside, well, extending NATO, which we thought would be deterrence is that was actually a provocation for Putin. But what should we just generally make of that lesson? First of all, I think you should look at the people living in the countries in question. So before we decide that we're the important people in the world, Americans or we're in Britain now or Britain's, and therefore anyone in between doesn't count, I believe that's wrong. So all of the countries that joined NATO desperately wanted to join NATO, right? And they've had a whole history of Russians doing terrible things to them. I'm not making it up. This is what Russia's been up to. They have been correct that Russia's going to do more terrible things. They were correct doing everything they could to get into NATO. And also be in the EU and they've, it's incredible in my lifetime. Remembering what the standards of living of people in Eastern Europe, that the Soviet Union had dominated and what it is now. Since they have been freed of Soviet domination, it's been massive compounding of standards of living. It's allowed people your age to travel the world, have a lot of aspirations in their lives. Right? If when you talk about, oh, should we deny these things because we got some egos in Russia that want to maintain a continental empire? I cannot or you cannot change how Russians think about things. Right? Russians have to, how they think about the things, that's their decision. But if you look at Europe as a peninsula, you're better off with more insulation from Russia than not. But isn't this another case that not thinking in terms of both courts or both halves of the court and tennis where compared to the possibility of nuclear war, just nudging that on number up and down matters far more than whether another country in Eastern Europe gets to be part of NATO or not? Well, I think what was hoped and it's, hope has been said not to be a strategy. The hope was that trying to get Russia to join the party. So trying to integrate their energy supplies into Europe, paying them good money for it, have them make lots of money on that, hoping that they would invest this into their road system, Which is lamentable, and hoping that they would invest this to cleaning out their business laws, which are, it's horrendous trying to run a business. As you watch right now, as different things get nationalized and taken over and different business leaders who are successful wind up unaccountably dropping out of six floor windows And things or old people always seem to fall down stairs. I think that's a special way of offing people. That was the hope is join the party because you will become wealthy too. Russian standards of living have been stagnating for quite a while that Putin's model of the basically taking over your neighbor's stuff and then whatever you have a bomb flat bringing Home is it's not an efficient way to make wealth and you're killing so many people. So I don't believe that we in the West have this denying people of Eastern Europe saying, well, actually, because the Russians have such an attitude, you get to be their serfs forever.",

I've actually, this is an interesting question of what percentage of the Soviet Union's GDP was dedicated to the NKVD or civil rights? I think when we were, the United States was trying to evaluate what the load of the military was on the economy and the CIA was trying to figure it out to the best of their ability. And then because they don't have a convertible currency, it's really difficult to, and then they're busy lying to each other. That's the whole other thing in communist states and dictatorships.

Collaborating with various influential countries in a maritime order can lead to a win-win situation. The United States, along with other nations, is working on managing global issues through agreement and collaboration, as seen in meetings with Europeans regarding Ukraine. The prosperity of nations is linked to participating in a maritime order. The growth of third-world countries has been significant since the Cold War, but challenges like private military interference from China in Africa can slow down growth. It is crucial to prioritize collaboration and agreements between nations for sustainable prosperity.","There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great. But no one's going to buy on, buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone else around. I get it. We're big and we're influential. Other people are influential too. But this maritime order where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other people in it. It's a win-win.

Over time, mismanagement and decentralization can lead to companies relocating, causing the network to collapse. Similar patterns can be observed in California's tech industry, where an initial concentration of companies in one place can be disrupted by shifts in market dynamics, such as the recent changes driven by the COVID pandemic and emerging technologies like cryptocurrency. The internet's initial promise to lessen geographical constraints paradoxically reinforced the concentration of tech companies in California, illustrating the complexities of industrial networks and their vulnerability.","Sure. But if it wasn't as networked, you could probably just move. And maybe these things are networked till they're not. Detroit was very networked. The car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades and decades and Michigan got more and more mismanaged and people thought the network sort of protected them because the Big three car companies were in Detroit but then you had all the supply chains were also in Detroit and then eventually it was just so ridiculous. People moved, started moving the factories outside of that area and it sort of unraveled. So that's – it can also happen with California.
It will just take a lot. Trevor Burrus That would be insane if they just abandon all the tech companies in California. I mean just look at what happened to Flint, Michigan, when all the auto factories pulled out.
Richard Pena Well, it's – look, I think you can – and it's always – there are all these paradoxical histories. The internet, the point of the internet in some sense was to eliminate the tyranny of place and that was sort of the idea. Then one of the paradoxes about the internet – history of the internet was that the internet companies were all centered in California. Then there probably, there have been different waves of how networked, how non-networked they were.

We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games. He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.

The speaker highlights that the priorities of historical Democratic leaders like Robert and John Kennedy, such as anti-war and anti-censorship, resonate with them, yet the party now caters to a more elite demographic. In contrast, the Republican Party has seemingly shifted to represent the working class and poorer segments of society. This realignment reflects broader socioeconomic divides where the Democratic Party, once a champion of the poor, appears more aligned with the wealthy elite, while the Republican Party gains traction among those feeling left behind.","Well, and you know, I do want to say that I feel like I didn't really leave the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party left me and left the ruins of the infrastructure that I think my Uncle and father had that had made them Democrats, if you went on a list of all of the priorities that Robert Kennedy, that John Kennedy had, I would check every box. They were anti-war. They were anti-censorship. They were against the corporate control of our country. This corrupt merger of state and corporate power that now has emerged as a dominant governing model in our country. The Democratic Party has changed demographically. When I grew up in a Democratic Party, that was the party of the working class in our country, that was a party of small businesses, that was the party of the poor. In the last election, President Biden got roughly half of the country voting for him, but that half controlled 70% of GDP. And President Trump got about half the country voting for him, and that half represents about 30% of GDP. So we've had this inversion where the Democratic Party has become the party of wealth of elites. And I would say very insular elites. And the Republican Party is now the party of the poor, the working class. And it's been, you know, for me to watch that, I've been on the front lines of watching it.","Well, and you know, I do want to say that I feel like I didn't really leave the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party left me and left the ruins of the infrastructure that I think my Uncle and father had that had made them Democrats, if you went on a list of all of the priorities that Robert Kennedy, that John Kennedy had, I would check every box.

Comparing students from vastly different environments—such as affluent areas versus disadvantaged inner-city or rural districts—highlights the disparity in educational equity. A standardized score, like the SAT, does not fully capture the challenges faced by disadvantaged students, who may possess greater raw talent despite their circumstances. The discussion emphasizes the need for evaluating candidates based on their socioeconomic status alongside traditional metrics, advocating for broader hiring practices that include diverse educational backgrounds to foster inclusivity and recognize true potential.","Yep.

However, a critical tipping point occurs when government employment comprises half or more of the workforce. At this juncture, the spirit of individual enterprise diminishes as government becomes the primary employer. The relationship between government spending and GDP suggests that as government outlays increase and approach 50% of GDP, individual liberties and incentives for entrepreneurship wane, leading to the mainstream acceptance of policies that may undermine economic freedom.","And I think that that's why this set of policies, and I'm not talking about the tax on the centimillionaires, as much as a simple disregard for the fact that the United States, over time, The prosperity that we've realized, has been driven by a free economy by enterprising individuals going out and saying there are people that are asking for things. I'm going to figure out a way to build those things and make it for them and sell it to them. People will pay for it. They will work hard to do it and the incentive structure in a free market has enabled productivity improvements and enabled ultimately prosperity. But we've reached a tipping point and the tipping point is when half or more of the population begins to be employed by the government, at which point that concept is lost. Because now it is the government that is the employer, not one's own individual liberties and ability to go out and be enterprising. And so I think that the budget of government tipping to 50% of GDP is the reason why these policies become mainstream. That's my theory.

This level of funding could lead to inflation due to the history of government-driven money causing bubbles and price increases. Despite the study highlighting micro, psychological, and social effects, the macro effects are clearly inflation and the difficulty of sustainable funding. Ultimately, the belief is that people prefer to work for their income, creating an inflationary cycle that makes universal basic income economically impractical.","And the second issue is just the net economic effect.

That's been the worst really of the last 10, 15 years. And then next comes UK, then Australia, and the US compared to these countries has been doing relatively better. And that's the irony of it. In terms of all the problems we've spoken about in America, but in terms of all the problems we spoke about in America, in terms of are much more severe in places like UK, that in terms of What it's been doing with its deficits, although America now has overtaken it in terms of what it's been doing in the number of zombie companies.

Companies like Dropbox, once characterized by their lean operations, face challenges when transitioning to a high-funding environment. Despite having a great product, suitable market fit, and effective viral distribution, Dropbox's ambitious plans were undermined by a lack of a robust and cohesive business strategy. Their situation illustrates that financial resources alone are insufficient for sustained success; a solid strategy is crucial for leveraging those resources effectively.","Yeah. Well, it's a different world these days. But then there is this kind of we've talked about a little bit on the SoftBank episode.

Berghain, its roots are as a gay club and its real roots are as like a really profoundly dirty gay sex club. And I say dirty without judgment. There's one section that is still devoted to that that is easier to get into, but the dress code for a Friday night is socks. So I didn't go. But even the main club is like it's really, it's like a space that's devoted to that. And so you already feel like an interloper and the rule is sort of like, this is a place where adults can do whatever they want and where they're guaranteed privacy and nobody talks about It. It's basically like German culture is realized they really don't like surveillance for very specific historical reasons. I found it to be like an entirely, oh, this just makes me sound like such a kook, but like, I always like this place is profound. Like it feels profound to be in a place where I don't know, really dedicated to complete self -expression where nothing that happens gets judged. I mean, I went on a Sunday afternoon. It was like 2 p .m. There were Berliners there who were just, that was their Sunday, that's what they always do. Aren't people who wait in line. There were people who probably have been waiting for eight hours and just gotten in and were so excited. I saw more expression of ways a human body could look or be dressed than I've seen in my whole life. And there were things that were happening that were like very burgheiny. Like they have something called a dark room, which is a room you can go in that's very under lit where people can do what they want to do to each other, usually gay But there's also like, They have an ice cream parlor.

Yeah. So it comes to an in-house debate within Marxism about whether the progress of true socialism is a universal thing experienced by all peoples in a similar path, or whether different Peoples and cultures might have different paths to Marxism. The Chinese variety of Marxist governments adopted the view that there could be multiple paths to true socialist liberation, and that the minority groups were underdeveloped. And so they needed to have other forms of education development first, and then they could have modern family norms. In particular, early Chinese was uniquely hostile to traditional Chinese culture.

Firstly, policies should fix what's broken by addressing issues like discouraging marriage within programs such as EITC, SNAP, and Section 8 housing vouchers. Secondly, providing financial support for parents to raise children is crucial as it is socially valuable work that benefits society in the long run. Lastly, changing rules such as allowing more flexible land use, reducing unnecessary labor regulations like occupational licensing, and challenging societal norms that limit access to opportunities can positively impact fertility rates by reducing the costs associated with raising children and enabling individuals to make choices that support their desire to have children.","Speaker 1
But there are lots and lots of policies that nudge a little bit each. And we can put them broadly in three buckets. One is fix what's broken. So I mentioned the EITC. The EITC currently discourages marriage. Marriage has a huge causal effect on birth rates. So we need to fix the discouragement of marriage. That means fixing programs like the EITC or SNAP or Section 8 housing vouchers, making them removing marriage penalties and removing any fertility penalties in them. So fix what's broken. Pay for it. So we should give people money to have kids because raising children is socially valuable work. It's not a handout.

In the meantime, we're bringing you an episode of On With Kara Swisher. Kara interviews Mira Murati, Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI, and one of the most powerful people in tech. Murati has helped the company skyrocket to the forefront of the generative AI boom, and Apple’s recent announcement that it will soon put ChatGPT in its iPhones, iPads and laptops will only help increase their reach. But there have been some issues along the way - including CEO Sam Altman's brief ouster, accusations of putting profit over safety, and the controversy over whether the company stole Scarlett Johansson's voice. Kara and Murati discuss it all. This interview was recorded live at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center in Washington, DC as part of their new Discovery Series.

Current government spending is about 20% of GDP, with 5% dedicated to servicing debt at near-zero interest rates. If interest rates rise, the government would struggle to manage its debt obligations. The Bank of Japan holds 53% of government bonds, amounting to 100% of GDP, reflecting an unsustainable reliance on central bank support. Contributing factors include a series of crises since the early 90s, leading to an escalation in public debt to support recovery efforts, alongside a rapidly aging population. Today, 33% of government spending is allocated to Social Security, compared to 20% in the US. The aging demographic pressures the government to sustain social programs while managing debt, with the looming issue of keeping interest rates low to avoid increased inflation. The inability to adjust interest rates effectively puts Japan in a precarious situation, facing potential economic contraction, extensive taxation, or inflation as a consequence of its significant debt burden.","<b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>To GDP ratio is currently 263%. They have about 1.3 quadrillion yen of public debt on an annual GDP of about 591 trillion yen. They're currently at the federal level spending about 20% of GDP per year. 5% of GDP is being spent per year just on servicing the existing debt. And that's at interest rates set by the central bank of roughly 0%. So, you know, or whatever the market is trading it at, so slightly above 0%. But if the central bank had to start to raise rates, because inflation started to run away because there's so much, again, in circulation, there's so much debt outstanding. The federal government would not be able to actually service this debt. So as of March of 2024, the Bank of Japan, the central bank, actually holds 53% of Japan's outstanding government bonds, which is equal to about 100% of Japan's GDP. So their central bank has bought the debt that's being issued by the federal government to fund their budget, a large chunk of which right now is being spent just on paying the interest On the debt, while interest rates are close to 0%. So imagine if interest rates bumped up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5%, as we're seeing with US Treasuries, we were recently at a nearly 5 handle on the 10-year Treasury, it would become an unsustainable Debt burden for the Japanese government to be able to handle that. And a large part of this is being driven by a number of crises that Japan has faced since the early 90s. So there was the financial crisis in a way, there was the nuclear meltdown, there was a couple of earthquakes, tsunamis, and a lot of debt has been taken on to support the country after Those crises. But really importantly, and Nick, if you could just pull up this age chart, is the aging of the Japanese population. So this chart shows that, and you can kind of see back to 1950, when the average age in Japan was 21 years old. And today, the average age in Japan is around 48. You know, in the next decade, it'll be 50, then it'll be 52. So that means more and more people are relying on public pension. Today, 33% of their government spending goes towards their Social Security programs. In the US, for comparison, Social Security is about 20% of federal spending. So that number is only getting bigger and bigger. As the population ages, the Japanese government has to continue to service their older population, and they've had to face several crises. Their debt has ballooned to a level that is well beyond any other industrialized nation. And the only way to continue to service that debt economically is to keep interest rates low. And the problem with keeping interest rate low? Inflation. And that's the big driver that caused them to say, let's uptake the interest by 15 bips or 25 bips is to try and tackle the inflation problem they're facing, just like our central bank Recently tried to do the same. But clearly the market can't have it. So Japan isn't a real pickle. And I think that it shows how much having a large amount of federal debt can impact the ability for a nation to maneuver itself during difficult times. And ultimately, debt payments come due, they come to you either in the form of economic contraction, or massive taxes or inflation. And currently, Japan is paying for it in terms of inflation.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>To GDP ratio is currently 263%.

We thought we’d closed the Acquired book on Nvidia back in April 2022. The story was all wrapped up: Jensen & crew had set out on an amazing journey to accelerate the world’s computing workloads. Along the way they’d discovered a wondrous opportunity (machine learning powered social media feed recommendations). They forged incredible Power in the CUDA platform, and used it to triumph over seemingly insurmountable adversity — the stock market penalty-box. But, it turned out that was only the precursor to an even wilder journey. Over the past 18 months Nvidia has weathered one of the steepest stock crashes in history ($500B+ market cap wiped away peak-to-trough!). And, it has of course also experienced an even more fantastical rise — becoming the platform that’s powering the emergence of perhaps a new form of intelligence itself… and in the process becoming a trillion-dollar company. Today we tell another chapter in the amazing Nvidia saga: the dawn of the AI era. Tune in!",,01:00:53,Challenges of Memory Scaling in AI Model Training,https://share.snipd.com/snip/7cc57b06-5f76-4926-a0a4-af57820c50ab,2min,59:15 - 01:00:51,"High-performance memory constraints in AI model training are challenging, as models require hundreds of gigabytes of memory, while the available on-chip RAM is limited. Memory scaling has not kept pace with the increasing size of AI models, leading to the need to network multiple chips and servers together for efficient training. The inability to increase memory chip size due to technological constraints necessitates close proximity of large memory amounts to processors for fast data transfer. This requirement highlights the importance of optimizing memory and data processing for effective model training.","Yes, there's this amazing video that we'll link to on the Asianometry YouTube channel that we link to also on the TSMC episode. But the constraint today is actually in how much high performance memory is available on the chip. These models need to be in memory all at the same time and they take up hundreds of gigabytes. So while memory has scaled up, I mean, we're going to get flashing all the way forward, the H100's on-chip RAM is like 80 gigabytes. The memory hasn't scaled up nearly as fast as the models have actually scaled in size. The memory requirements for training AI are just obscene. So it becomes imperative to network multiple chips and multiple servers of chips and multiple racks of servers of chips together into one single computer, and I'm putting computer And air quotes there, in order to actually train these models. It's also worth noting, we can't make the memory chips any bigger. Due to a quirk of the extreme ultraviolet photolithography that we talked about, the EUV on the TSMC episode, chips are already the full size of the reticle. It's a physics and wavelength constraint. You really can't etch chips larger without some new invention that we don't have commercially viable yet. So what it ends up meaning is you need huge amounts of memory, very close to the processors, all running in parallel with the fastest possible data transfer. And again, this is a vast oversimplification, but you kind of get the idea of why all of this becomes so important.",

This ruling would very much protect Biden. And Chief Justice Roberts writes that presidents many controversial and unpopular acts that are not hard to characterize as criminal. Do you want the next president to be prosecuting the former one that's never been part of the American legal tradition? So this is good, I suppose, for outgoing presidents who will not be prosecuted by their political rivals over what they did in office. But it does a second thing. It emboldens the next president and the president after that to test the boundaries of presidential power because they'll know that the Supreme Court has said, there is almost nothing They can do in an arguably official way, that will ever cause them to be prosecuted criminally after they leave office.

Unlike older expert systems, modern AI models are trained with data and compute resources, leading to emergent intelligence. This emergent intelligence allows for capabilities beyond what is hard-coded, requiring testing over several years to understand fully. The speaker emphasizes the limitless potential of emergent intelligence in AI development, contrasting it with the controlled ceiling under human-designed code.","I cannot make a case that he's right. He's wrong in so many ways. It's difficult for me to remember all of them. He's a Facebook buddy, so I have a lot of fun having those little debates with him. So I'm trying to remember the arguments. So one, he says we are not gifted this intelligence from aliens. We are designing it. We are making decisions about it. That's not true. It was true when we had expert systems, symbolic AI, decision trees. Today you set up parameters for a model and you water this plant. You give it data, you give it compute and it grows. And after it's finished growing into this alien plant, you start testing it to find out what capabilities it has. And it takes years to figure out even for existing models. If it's trained for six months, it will take you two, three years to figure out basic capabilities of that system. We still discover new capabilities in systems which are already out there.

We examine what works and what doesn’t, how certain regions evolve into startup hubs and economic powerhouses, and what constitutes entrepreneurial talent. We also discuss the nature of ambition, the journey to finding one’s path, and broader mindsets for navigating risk, reward, and dynamism across various regions, with a particular focus on London and Europe. Joining us is Matt Clifford, who played a pivotal role in the London entrepreneurial and tech ecosystem since 2011...","1. Value creation in startups is viewed as a shared journey, benefiting not just customers but also employees who contribute to the success. 2. Startups enable employees to share in the financial rewards generated by collective efforts, contrasting with traditional employment's salary limitations. 3. This model fosters a culture of innovation and risk-taking, emphasizing the ethical responsibility of founders and their teams to capture only the value they actively create. 4. Acknowledging the risks and potential gains positions startups as a space for meaningful financial engagement that is advantageous for all stakeholders.",15:32,Value Creation is a Shared Journey,https://share.snipd.com/snip/62df553b-9560-4ede-b508-b8c75770494b,2min,13:52 - 15:33,"Understanding startups as platforms for shared success highlights a profound insight: when creating something that people need, the benefits can extend beyond customers to the employees who contribute to that success. Unlike traditional employment, where wealth is limited to salaries, startups allow employees to share in the financial rewards generated by their collective efforts. This model promotes innovation and risk-taking, reinforcing an ethical dimension where founders and their teams only capture the value they actively create. By acknowledging the risks and potential for substantial gains, we see startups as a space for meaningful financial engagement that benefits everyone involved.","I mean, it seems now that you say it, it seems so obvious, but it's really not like just a pause on the idea when you're doing a startup, you're building something that other people want And need. That's a really profound idea. On that note, it's also very fascinating because of the economics of startups, because usually if you're working for a company, you were talking about you and Alice being at McKinsey Consulting, people think they're making good money, you know, but you're really captive to your salary. You're not actually the wealth is not generative. And one thing that I find really powerful about startups is that startups are the ones that innovated on the idea that employees can have a share of the returns on the work they do. So even though you might be building a product for customers and consumers that people want, if you succeed, you know, it can also be go to nothing, obviously, that's the very real risk. But if you succeed, there can be very real gains for the people who put things in, especially for those that took a risk early on...","<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I mean, it seems now that you say it, it seems so obvious, but it's really not like just a pause on the idea when you're doing a startup, you're building something that other people want And need.

They support Bernie Sanders' ideas, expressing concern that the American dream of working 40 hours a week for a dignified life is fading away. The speaker acknowledges the complexity of the world and suggests that these societal shifts are influencing our current experiences.","And I can just see that the world that I grew up in in the 60s and 70s is just different on the most basic level. Can a young person like my dad did at 21, 22 buy a house? Hmm. Are there a lot of jobs out there where you can show up for 40 hours a week and have all your needs met and your dignity preserved? Hmm. So I think Bernie Sanders is on the right track about a lot of this stuff and the idea that we have had a slow drift into a drift away from what I would consider kind of the American dream, Which is, let me go to work 40 hours a week and in exchange, you give me a life full of dignity. I think we're not there anymore. So I think if you take those two things together, that explains a lot of what we're experiencing. Again, who knows? I mean, the world is vast and my mind is small.",

Der Freiburger Wirtschaftsprofessor Lars Feld spricht über den Wettbewerb in der EU, in dem es zunehmend um industriepolitisch motivierte Gelder geht: “Ein Schönheitswettbewerb um die höchsten Zuweisungen.” Er verweist auf katastrophale Bürokratie und auf die Bedeutung der Europawahlen: “Man sollte nicht mit expressivem Wählen seinen Gefühlen Ausdruck verleihen, sondern genauer hinschauen: Was ist passiert und wer ist verantwortlich dafür?”<br/>Der Düsseldorfer Wettbewerbsökonom wird noch direkter: “Ich würde der ersten Kommissionspräsidentschaft von Frau von der Leyen jetzt nicht ein übermäßig positives Zeugnis ausstellen. Der Bürokratieabbau stand sicherlich eher unten auf der Agenda.”<br/>Zu Beginn aber eine Einordnung der Steuerschätzung mit den Milliarden an geringeren Einnahmen, wobei sich dabei auch das Thema Wachstum ergibt. Vor diesem Hintergrund fließen Rückmeldungen aus den Reihen der Hörerinnen und Hörer ein. Am Schluss wird in der obligatorischen Nachspielzeit erörtert, was bei der Trainersuche von Bayern München ähnlich schief läuft wie bei den Auseinandersetzungen innerhalb der Ampelregierung.<br/>Die komplette Ausgabe hören Sie als Teil unserer Pioneer-Familie.

Capitalism accepts winners and losers, rewarding hard work and talent. However, the system has shifted towards cronyism, favoring owners and becoming inequitable and unsustainable over time.","We can't say for sure what percent owners pay on average, but it's less than most of their employees pay. This complexity results in a transfer of wealth from earners to owners. The tax code has exploded from 400 to 4000 pages in the past few decades. If you have GPS, advisors, loopholes for the wealthy, you want races run at night. If the government is meant to decrease suffering and add happiness, then our current system makes no sense. Paying taxes of $5 million on $10 million in income is the difference between flying first class and flying private. Paying $15,000 on $60,000 in income might mean forgoing a second child. Capitalism means accepting a society of winners and losers. And that's okay. Wealth is a great reward for hard work, and talent is what drives us to create value. And capitalism has brought prosperity to billions over the past 150 years. The problem is the system, if left unchecked, becomes increasingly inequitable and unsustainable. We've morphed from capitalism to cronyism, rigged in favor of owners. How?","We can't say for sure what percent owners pay on average, but it's less than most of their employees pay. ..."

Elon Musk's move to Texas saved him $2.5 billion in California income tax, while Jeff Bezos relocated to Florida to save on taxes and sold 50 million shares of Amazon. The choice to benefit from infrastructure and resources in one state while not contributing to taxes can be seen as a disservice to the community and a disproportionate burden on middle-class taxpayers.","Several years ago, the media discovered the phenomenon of California entrepreneurs moving to Texas and Florida, and there was a lot of jazz hands about those state's friendly business Climates and youthful energy. The truth was simpler. Texas and Florida have no state income tax, and many of those founders were about to recognize enormous gains via sales of stock that had become worth billions. Elon Musk, who moved to Texas in 2020, sold millions of shares of Tesla, saving an estimated $2.5 billion in California income tax. When Washington state enacted a tax on income from asset sales, Jeff Bezos decided to spend more time with his father in Florida, which has no income tax, and sold 50 million shares of Amazon after he relocated.

(SSI), a startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, which has secured a staggering $1 billion in funding. SSI s mission to develop safe superintelligence through long-term research and development is explored, along with the challenges and controversies surrounding this ambitious venture.  The episode then shifts gears to discuss Volkswagen s integration of ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, promising a more interactive and capable driving experience. This innovative feature will be available in various 2024 and 2025 models, starting with the ID 4 electric vehicle. We highlight the system s ability to handle complex queries while maintaining user privacy and data security.  The highlight of the episode is an exciting development in biohybrid robotics: a robot controlled by a living mushroom. Created by scientists at Cornell University, this innovative robot uses the mycelium network of a king oyster mushroom as both a sensor and control system. We discuss the potential applications of this technology in agriculture and environmental monitoring, as well as the advantages of using fungi as biological controllers in robotics.

This opens possibilities for developing fungal-controlled robots in agriculture to monitor soil and optimize fertilizer usage, as well as in environmental monitoring for assessing water quality and detecting pollutants. Fungi, being robust and capable of thriving in diverse conditions, present a sustainable alternative to traditional robotic systems due to their biodegradable nature, minimizing ecological impact. However, addressing challenges around scaling and real-world application integration remains crucial as this technology evolves, potentially leading to responsive, autonomous bio-hybrid machines that align with ecological principles.","The Fungal network can sense and respond to multiple environmental inputs, including chemical, biological, and physical stimuli. It can adapt and reconfigure itself based on environmental changes, demonstrating biological intelligence. This technology could be particularly useful in agriculture, where fungal-controlled robots could monitor soil conditions and optimize fertilizer use, and for environmental Monitoring tasks, such as assessing water quality or detecting pollutants. The use of fungi as biological controllers offers several advantages over traditional robotic systems. Fungi are robust organisms that can thrive in diverse and harsh conditions, making these bio-hybrid robots suitable for challenging environments. Their biodegradable nature could reduce the ecological footprint of robotic systems, offering a sustainable alternative to non-biodegradable materials.

This approach contrasts with 'manager mode,' where leaders interact primarily through reports. By mastering the details of their businesses, founders can navigate challenges more effectively, as demonstrated by Brian Chesky of Airbnb, who shifted his focus back to daily operations after relying too heavily on executives. This hands-on approach has been recommended by influential figures like Paul Graham, and it's crucial for founders, especially women, to feel empowered to adopt this mode of leadership to foster innovation and growth.","When you took me to the White House and we were talking to all those lovely young assistants and pages and everybody and I started talking about TikTok and they said none of us, none of Us have it, we're not allowed to be on it.

There's a new buzzword in Silicon Valley, founder mode. Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham wrote a viral blog post over the weekend urging startup founders to embrace a hands-on leadership show called founder mode. It was from a speech that Brian Chesky gave, which was a little taken out of context a little bit. According to Graham, founders should be involved in the minutiae of running their businesses in contrast to manager mode, where leaders engage in their companies only through direct Reports. There's been an, he was inspired to write it after hearing a talk by Airbnb Brian Chesky, who did involve himself back in the business after having hired too many professional executives. I think that was his point, which he's talked about before. Chesky, also I've spoken to Chesky about this because I sent him all the funny memes about it. You know, Jesus was in founder mode with the loaves and fishes, because it wouldn't scale until he got involved. There's a bunch of very funny memes about it.

User-generated content platforms are not a consumer right but a service provided by the platform. Users have other avenues like creating blogs or websites to express themselves. Companies have the right to determine the type of platform they want, whether allowing free speech or opting for a highly moderated environment. Government intervention in dictating content on social media platforms is discouraged to maintain editorial independence.","Yeah, that's a key issue. Freeberger, thoughts? Yeah, so I've said for a long time, we've obviously had conversations about Twitter and shadow banning and some of the other activities what are typically called social media platforms. At the end of the day, these are all, as I've shared in the past, my belief is they're all content companies. They have a choice as executives and as editors of those companies to decide how to editorialize the content on their platforms. They can choose to create content with writers that they pay on staff, like a newspaper might. They can choose to create content with actors and directors that they pay to create novel video series for them, like HBO might, or they can choose to make content creation available To third parties that don't get paid like users. And at the end of the day, what they choose to do with that content and how they choose to display that content is up to them as an editorial platform that is ultimately creating content For other consumers. I don't view that user -generated content platforms are a right of the consumers to have access to share their thoughts. They have the internet to do that, and they have many other places that they can go to to create blogs, to create websites, to do whatever else they want to do to express themselves, but To have a technological platform that lets them submit content, that then the editors get to decide how and where they show that content. I think they should understand because it's in the terms and conditions when you sign up. So I don't believe in social media platforms as utilities.

This necessitates a mindset that prioritizes long-term investment, both materially and mentally—in the hope for a better future. Holding a default pessimistic view is counterproductive when planning for an uncertain but potentially brighter future.","The bad stuff lands like a thud, generating headlines and invoking worst-case scenarios that drown out the sound of anything else.

Even if you don't believe me, make your investment in the future anyway, just in case I end up being right again. Plant your seed regardless. If you end up being right in your pessimism many years from now, we will all have bigger problems than what our investments are worth. Being optimistic all the time is difficult.

I think that this is a really important watershed moment. And it reminds me of 1997. Nick, throw this little image up. In 1997, David Bowie issued what was then famously called the Bowie bond. It was $55 million that yielded 7.5%, which is about 80 bips above the 10 year at the time. These were 10 year bonds. That's awesome. I didn't know that. The bond payments were linked to 20 albums that Bowie had released before 1990. And so these are like 280 songs. And what he basically said was like, listen, folks, you're essentially buying a piece of me. And in this case, my past work. And I'm going to take this $55 billion upfront. And you're going to get paid this interest based on the royalties that I generate off that historic library for a 10 year period. We think you're going to get paid the $55 million plus a 7.5% a year. And then I'm going to take back the rights. And if I default, if these bonds default, you will own the songs. And it turned out that it was an incredible bet. The people that bought it, I think it was Prudential, which was an insurance company. They got paid. The bonds did not default. In 2007, Bowie took back the ownership of that catalog, of that back catalog. But instead, what he had was 55 million upfront, which allowed him to go and buy all kinds of other parts of his catalog that he didn't otherwise own. So why is this interesting? This was the first example, I think of people monetizing themselves, their name and their likeness. In this case, it was done via debt. I actually think when you look today, what's happening is a more sophisticated version of that movement, but at much larger scale. I mean, we were all joking that there was a bunch of meme coins that launched, not with any of our support, by the way, but with our names, with all these other quasi famous people's names, Those things went up and were worth millions of dollars of value. And I think what this Donald J. Trump, the DJT company, what it represents, is effectively a trading coin, a baseball card, if you will, a trading card via a stock on the value of Donald Trump's enterprise value, his Name, his recognition and his likeness. So this, I think, is the modern instantiation of the Bowie bond. And what's incredible is you can see, Bowie, 30 or 40 years ago, he could have generated 55 million dollars in inflation adjusted dollars. That's about 100 million in today's dollars. Trump, three and a half, four billion. I think it sits on top of this idea that these very famous people, the Kim Kardashian's of the world, the Donald Trump's of the world, the Mr. Beasts of the world, can eventually take companies public. And when you take a company public, you have to remember Jason. There's the revenue in the profits, right? But if you look at the balance sheet of a company, there is always a line item called Goodwill. And Goodwill is what people use to separate the assets and the liabilities and whatever is left over to generate the shareholder equity. So in this case, Donald Trump, the GJT company's balance sheet, will show a ginormous entry in Goodwill. And that is the value of his name. Coca-Cola has such a Goodwill line item. PepsiCo does, Gatorade does, Nike does, and this company does. And I think there's going to be a lot of other companies that will go public. That effectively generate a huge Goodwill line item that represents the name brand value of the person associated with it. So you're a buyer? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that there is a lot of people that will be buyers that essentially will buy this as a Donald Trump, a directional bet on the value of his brand. And I'm also predicting that many other individuals will go public and have enterprise values that are levered in the same way as DJT. And that is a modern version of the boy bond from 97.","<details><summary>Click to expand</summary><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Here's what I'll say.

I remain steadfast in my commitment to there being only one major issue facing this country. And that is the federal debt and the deficit. We are increasing the federal debt by a trillion dollars every hundred days. That number is not slowing down. The current budget proposal from the Biden administration calls for over seven point two trillion dollars to be spent next year. That makes the US federal government roughly one third of our country's GDP. The outrageousness of the condition that the US is in right now makes it so insane to me that we are talking about any other topic like big agriculture or whatever other nonsense was being Spattered about as important topics to this particular person. If every voting citizen in the United States does not recognize the severity of the deficit and debt problem that the federal government faces, you are wasting your vote.

Major crises have led to increased spending, with around 3 million Americans directly employed by the federal government.","<details><summary>Click to expand</summary><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>An increase spending is stimulatory. And so it works well in an election year. I would say we took two major crises and we had crisis level spending. And then we normalized that spending and allowed it to carry forward, starting with the OA financial crisis with our monetary policy and then being accelerated with COVID and our fiscal Policy. I'll give you guys, I did come back to the envelope map. I'm sure there are economists who have done a better job of this than I. There are directly 3 million Americans that are directly employed by the federal government. There's 167 million workers in the US. So 3 million are directly employed by the federal government. If you take the rest of the federal spending that flows into the economy, it's about 3.5 trillion a year and assume 30% of that capital goes to equity holders and businesses that own businesses That benefit from that spending and the rest flows through to labor. That's about 13% of GDP flowing through to labor. And assuming average annual income, that's another roughly 45, 50 million people that are directly benefiting that are directly earning income because of federal spending. There's another 50 million people in the US that rely on Social Security. And here's another important statistic. There's somewhere between 12 and 20 million people in the US that pay more than 50% tax rate today. So those people are effectively working for the federal government because half of their income goes back to the government. So when you add this all up, there's over 100, 120 million people in the US that are directly working for or getting paid by the federal government in the US. That is such a significant percentage of our economy that is such a significant dependency on individual income on a federal government. I don't want to use the term socialism, but the ability for US labor to earn is so largely dependent and largely driven by federal spending at this point.</blockquote></details>"

Cocoa is grown from the cacao tree, which is about 10 feet tall. These bean pods can take them down. You roast the beans, crush it, you make cocoa. When you eat a Hershey's bar, for example, 11% of that bar is ground up cocoa powder. So cocoa is like the critical ingredient and all the chocolate products we consume. So we had this massive El Nino event last year. So here you can see sea surface temperatures. So in Q4 of last year, El Nino spiked like crazy. And that caused a lot of rainfall to hit the West Coast of Africa. And as a result, this fungus was spread in cocoa trees. There's a fungus called black pod disease. And this fungus spreads when rainfall hits the ground and it splashes up, gets in the tree. And then the tree has really bad yield and the cocoa production goes down. So now if you look at the cocoa production out of Ghana, you can see that we've seen a like 50% rough decline in cocoa production on the final bar chart. So that's the effect. So when that happened, basically, everyone started to corner the market. So all the buyers of cocoa went in and started buying cocoa like crazy.

Including cost of borrowing in inflation calculations could lead to significantly higher inflation rates, affecting consumer sentiment on the economy negatively despite positive GDP growth and low unemployment rates, ultimately posing a challenge for policymakers.","I mean, one is for the consumer, this means that the cost of borrowing is going to be higher for longer. That makes it harder to buy a house, mortgage payments are higher. That also means if there's fewer home sale transactions, that means the price of housing could come down. So there could be a correction in that market. Second, if you want to buy a car, your car payments higher, and if you have loans, your personal interest is going to be higher. And this is why I think consumers feel like they're worse off than the economic data would otherwise reflect. And Larry Summers actually had a tweet storm about this about a month ago, where he calculated that if you included the cost of borrowing in inflation, that inflation was much higher Than people thought and that it actually peaked not at 9%, but at 18%. So Larry had an excellent tweet storm on that. And he said that the cost of borrowing, which used to be calculated in inflation, but is not anymore, was the reason why consumer sentiment about the economy was depressed. He said that accounted for about 70% of it. So people should be feeling better off because GDP growth is good and unemployment is low, but they're not because inflation is so high. And if you include cost of borrowing, the inflation is even higher. So I think this is really bad news for Biden, but it's a story that's been going on now for three years.","I mean, one is for the consumer, this means that the cost of borrowing is going to be higher for longer.

2. OPEC's ability to manipulate oil production affects global market efforts to lower prices, with significant influence due to higher production compared to the US.
3. Government actions can impact interest rates and inflation, with potential stimulatory measures near elections leading to increased inflation concerns.

But on the most fundamental level, physicists aren't sure whether the sort of time we experience exists at all. We talk to three experts and find out if time could potentially be moving backwards as well as forwards.

It doesn't flow as a fundamental feature, any more than space flows. We have the impression that time flows because entropy is increasing, which gives us the arrow of time, whereas there's no arrow of space. The idea that we are propelled through time by some sense of flow is just a consequence of our macroscopic existence in a world where entropy is increasing. Entropy is a way for physicists to talk about the disorderliness, randomness, and disorganization of a system. The early universe near the Big Bang was very low entropy, organized, and non-random. Since then, it has been increasing in entropy. The universe creates more entropy by creating pockets of orderliness, like us. Entropy is a way of counting how many ways there are to arrange atoms without changing the overall look and feel of an object. The universe tends to move towards higher entropy configurations because there are more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.","Time is a coordinate on space time. It doesn't flow as a fundamental feature, any more than space flows. We have a impression that time flows because entropy is increasing, which gives us the arrow of time, whereas there's no arrow of space. But that doesn't mean it's illusion. Space can be just as real as time is. So I think the time is real. But the idea that we are propelled through it by some sense of flow is just a consequence of our macroscopic existence in a world where entropy is going up. Okay, can we just talk through this entropy business? Entropy is a way that physicists have of talking about the disorderlyness, the randomness, the disorganization of some system. The early universe near the Big Bang 14 billion years ago, it turns out when you run the numbers, was very, very low entropy was very, very special, was very, very organized and non-random. And it's been sort of relaxing and getting more random and more disorganized ever since. And you might think that that's just a story of decay and disruption, right? If everything's just getting more random. But along the way, one of the ways that the universe makes more entropy is to create little pockets of orderliness like you and me. And we're doing our job by talking and sweating and moving things around to actually increase the entropy of the universe. Because basically the way to think about entropy is entropy is a way of counting how many ways there are to arrange your atoms without changing the overall look and feel of an object. So if things are sort of separate, if there's cream and coffee that are separated from each other, you can mix up the cream within itself or the coffee within itself and everything is Fine. But once they're all mixed together, there's vastly more ways to rearrange the atoms because they're all mixed up with each other. So that's a higher entropy configuration. And that's where the universe goes. So the simple idea is just entropy increases over time because there are more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Time is a coordinate on space time.

Initially dismissed, Vietnam War protesters were eventually seen as having a point, which might also happen with Google protesters. The current Gaza conflict may be viewed as Israel's Vietnam due to facing a guerrilla force leading to a quagmire, resembling a game of whack-a-mole with Hamas reappearing in different areas after supposedly being cleared by Israel.","Well, Google had no choice but to fire these employees. They were being disruptive and they were trespassing and Google has a business to run. So this is what any business would do. And I don't think they deserve either credit or blame for taking the action they took. In terms of the protesters themselves, I think that in the fullness of time, we may come to think of them in a slightly different light. And some of this reminds me a little bit of another war. The protesters in another war, the Vietnam War, where they were very disruptive. In some cases, they trespassed. In some cases, they got arrested. They were easy to make fun of in terms of what they look like. They were sort of unkempt, unshaven, all the rest of that stuff, they were hippies. And at the time, people were, I'd say, very dismissive of them or actually antagonistic. They were seen as giving aid and comfort to the enemy. And they were sort of demonized. But now in the fullness of time, we look back on that war and realize that they had a point. In fact, maybe they were right. In fact, maybe their actions were justified. And I think that how we view these protesters at Google can't just be judged now. I think it's going to be judged in the fullness of time based on how we perceive this war in Gaza. And I want to make two points about why I think this war will eventually be viewed as Israel's Vietnam. The first is that in Gaza, Israel faces a guerrilla style force. And they're in a quackmire. And if you read the latest news that's coming out of Gaza, what you'll hear is that after Israel has supposedly cleared an area like Gaza City or Khan Eunice, they then move south, Hamas Has popped back up again. This whole idea that they can clear an area has been proven false. It's like playing whack-a-mole. They basically hit Hamas in one area. Hamas disappears down the tunnels. They come back in a different area.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Well, Google had no choice but to fire these employees...come back in a different area.</blockquote>"

They need to possess critical thinking skills, curiosity, and the ability to work autonomously in challenging and fast-paced environments. Their role involves traveling to dangerous locations, engaging with individuals holding national security information, and securely relaying that information back to decision makers.","One of the things that I continually talk about is the importance for our officers to be really experts at human beings, to understand how it is that we can persuade or work with somebody Who wants to volunteer their services to the CIA, what is that type of information that they can provide to us? What's valuable? What questions should we be asking? What should we be asking us follow up in terms of the qualities that we expect from our officers, really in terms of their ability to think critically, have an incredible curiosity about Situations, be able to operate autonomously, because many times we're placing them in difficult situations in which they have to react very quickly and have the mental agility to Figure out, okay, how do we react under different situations?

The long-term horizon of private equity investors allows them to navigate economic cycles and leverage to enhance returns, making it an attractive investment strategy that emphasizes operational expertise and value creation.","Or is there a structural advantage to private equity investing? And there are some structural advantages. One, private equity firms have to raise money with a long lock up, which by the way, as an easy investors like to be able to get their money back if they need it. Typically they raise money long. And that is you have to give them or commit your capital for seven years. They have access to very low interest rates. They take control positions.

Extremism in society, fueled by a shift to the right, can lead to a cycle of increased polarization and radicalization.","I think a lot of the things you just said are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated. So let me try. So not everybody in Israel. Of course. Let's look at several groups. So people in government, IDF soldiers, and citizens that are neither of those. And not everybody of any of those sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage. So it's mostly the focus of your commentary. When you say people in Israel, you really mean the people in power. People need power. But as much as like, of course, I mean the people apart, because when I speak about, because I even when I speak about America, I speak about people in power. When I speak about Egypt, I speak the people of power, because like in a country, you talk about the 100 million people in Egypt, or the 11 million people in Israel.

This highlights the importance of funding a variety of projects, ranging from flying cars to art, as there is a need for more ventures across different sectors.","Like, and you wouldn't want to live in a world, you know, imagine living in a world where there's no fiction, because everybody's like, oh, you know, the the grinds are like, oh, fiction Is not useful.

The captains had to convince the investors of their strategy to find whales, keep their crew alive, and choose the right equipment and boat. This historical method of funding ventures is still prevalent today, where individuals debate ideas and allocate funds to finance projects for potential future success.","And so if you go back to how the whaling journeys off like the coast of Maine and like the 1600s are funded, there were a group of what we, you know, they didn't call themselves venture capitalists At that time, but they were a group of basically, you know, capitalists. And they would sit, you know, in a tavern or something, and they would, you know, get pitches by whaling captains, you know, about, you know, and you can imagine the whaling captains, Right? Like, I mean, like whaling, right, whaling, like a third of the whaling journeys never came back, right? Like a third of the time the boats got destroyed and everybody drowned, right? And so it's like, okay, I'm the captain who's going to be able to like not only go get the whale, but like I'm going to be able to keep my crew alive. And by the way, I have a strategy and a theory for where the whale is, right? And maybe one guy's like, look, I'm going to go where everybody knows there are whales and other guys going to be like, no, that place is overfished. I'm going to go to some other place where nobody thinks there's a whale, but I think there is. And then one guy's going to say, I'm better to assembling a crew than the other. And the other one's like, well, no, I don't even need the crew. I just need like a bunch of like whatever grunts to like, and I'm going to do all the all the work. And then another guy might say, you know, I want a small fast boat, another guy might say, I want to, you know, a big slow boat. Right. And so there's a set of people like imagine in the tavern at candlelight, like at night, like debating all this back and forth, saying, okay, this captain on this journey, not that captain On that journey.

As a manager climbs the career ladder, transitioning from managing individual contributors to managing managers is a critical breakthrough. This transition allows for scalability in leadership roles within an organization, starting from being an individual contributor to eventually becoming a CEO overseeing a team of executives.","Well, look, sometimes they've done it before, right? And so, so, okay. So I guess I'd say this, the big thing with like being able to run things at scale, there's actually a very big breakthrough that people either make or they don't make. And then, and the very big breakthrough is whether they know how to manage managers, right? And so, because the reason for that is like running a big company, you don't have, you don't say you're running a company with 100,000 employees. You don't have 100,000 direct reports, right? You still only have like eight or 10 direct reports. And then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports, then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports. And so even the CEOs of really big companies, they're only really dealing with like eight or 10 or 12 people on a daily basis. Like, and so, and so the key breakthrough, right? And then how do you become trained as a manager? The way you become trained as a manager initially is you manage a team of individual contributors, right? So I'm an engineering manager. I have eight, you know, or 10 coders working for me. And then the breakthrough is, can I, am I trained at how to become a manager of managers, right? And so if I'm really my career, the way I think about that is I start out as an individual contributor, let's say an engineer. I get trained at how to be a manager of individual contributors. And that makes me an engineering manager. And then if I get promoted to what they call engineering director, which is one level up, now I'm a director and now I'm managing a team of managers, anybody who can make that jump now has A generalizable skill of being able to manage managers. And then what makes that skill so great is that skill can scale, right? Because then you can get promoted to VP of engineering. Now you have a team of directors who have teams of managers who have teams of ICs, right? And so forth.

And then, and the very big breakthrough is whether they know how to manage managers, right? And so, because the reason for that is like running a big company, you don't have, you don't say you're running a company with 100,000 employees. You don't have 100,000 direct reports, right? You still only have like eight or 10 direct reports. And then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports, then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports. And so even the CEOs of really big companies, they're only really dealing with like eight or ten or twelve people on a daily basis. Like, and so, and so the key breakthrough, right? And then how do you become trained as a manager? The way you become trained as a manager initially is you manage a team of individual contributors, right? So I'm an engineering manager. I have eight, you know, or 10 coders working for me. And then the breakthrough is, can I, am I trained at how to become a manager of managers, right? And so if I'm really my career, the way I think about that is I start out as an individual contributor, let's say an engineer. I get trained at how to be a manager of individual contributors.

So Nokia and Microsoft in particular, Blackberry had these closed proprietary operating systems. And then the telcos put their apps on and make money and basically had control over whether or not people could access Google and Google services through their phone. So the intention with open sourcing Android was to make sure that Google was not disadvantaged in their core business over time. I think that there's a similar analogy here that by open sourcing, these models, they limit competition because VCs are no longer going to plow half a billion dollars into a foundational Model development company. So you limit the commercial interest and the commercial value of foundational models. Now, the CapEx question is a really hard one to diagnose because we don't know how they're spending the money, where they're spending the money, what they're doing in there.

The productivity of humans may not decrease as there are tasks that scale with population size. Moreover, there is the possibility of enhancing human productivity through augmentation, focusing on well-being rather than just physical care. It is challenging to predict the new equilibrium, but it seems unlikely that humans will run out of tasks. Constraints on computing resources also play a role until AI addresses certain limitations. Additionally, the impact of AI on the workforce includes reducing stress related to making mistakes in jobs.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it's certainly possible that you can end up in a more capital intensive economy. And so there's no necessary reason that it has to go one way or the other. But in the end, there's a lot of things where the humans can be productive and they even can be productive in a world of robots. So if you think about taking care of older people or taking care of younger people, that's a nice example because it tends to sort of scale with the size of the population. And we're going to have young people and we're going to have old people. And there's really can be a pretty low productive ratio of humans looking after other humans. So that just suggests to me that the marginal product of humans isn't going to go down. And in fact, we may find ways to augment humans so that they can be productive longer or be productive with less knowledge. So for example, for elder care, more focused on the well-being side of things rather than just the physical care. So I think I agree with you that we just can't necessarily imagine what the new equilibrium looks like, but it seems hard for me to imagine that there aren't things for humans to do. And also until the AI solves electricity and figures out how to make a lot more chips, we will still have constraints on the resources that are used on computing.</blockquote>",<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it's certainly possible that you can end up in a more capital intensive economy.

Just like adopting a nice notation in algebra can reveal non-trivial implications, programming can lead to insights by allowing the machine to crunch data and generate plots. There is a potential for the process of using programming tools to become more fluid, akin to the ease of solving algebraic problems on a whiteboard. However, for in-depth mathematical exploration, traditional mediums like paper still hold value, but transitioning to mediums that facilitate simulation and programming could revolutionize problem-solving approaches.","Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude. Would have been hard to think. We have the word orders of magnitude in a way that is hard to write down much less. Think about if you're doing Roman numerals. Like, is there something analogous to that for our descendants? I mean, fluency with a programming interface really can help understanding certain problems. I think when people mess around in a notebook with something, and when it feels like a really good tool set, there's a way that that has the same sensation as adopting a nice notation in That you write something with a small number of symbols, but then you discover a lot about the implication of that. In the case of notation, it's because the rules of algebra are very constrained. And so when you write something, you can go through an almost game-like process to see how it reduces and expands, and then see something that might be non-trivial. And in the case of programming, of course, the machine is doing the crunching, and you might get a plot that reveals some extra data. I think we're maybe at a phase where there's room for that to become a much more fluid process, such that rather than having these small little bits of friction, like you've got to set Up the environment, and you've got to like it in a notebook, you've got to find the right libraries, that there's something that feels as fluid as when you are good at algebra, and you're Just at a whiteboard kind of noodling it out. I think there's something to be said for the fact that there's still so much more value in... If you and I were going to go into some math topic right now, you ask me something that's a terrible question for a podcast, but I'm like, oh, let's actually dig into it. The right medium to do that is still paper. I think I would break out some paper and we would scribble it out. And so whenever it becomes the case that the right medium to do that lends itself to simulation and to programming and all that, that feels like it would get to the point where it shifts The way that you even think about stuff. Yeah, that's really interesting.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude. Would have been hard to think.

Taking walks, car rides, or being the 'Uber driver' on weekends can provide chances for children to open up. Engaging in activities where there is no pressure for conversation can lead to spontaneous sharing. Additionally, identifying and participating in children's hobbies, even if they differ from one's own interests, can strengthen the bond between parent and child.

It's interesting the young people actually want to work in an office. The first thing they do, a couple of our star employees moved to London. I said fine, moved to London. The first thing they did was they got an office. They got a co-share, what do you call it? Workshare? Co-uber? No, it's not Uber. We were, Adam Newman. Anyways, they got a shared office space. And the young people, because they're exceptionally ambitious, all wanted to be in an office together, definitely is some sort of electricity or Jwada Veever, whatever the fuck you Want to call unknown about getting everyone together. So I would focus on employee satisfaction, and I would focus on retention, and I would try if possible to try and make it a poll, not a push that people want to come into the office. And you already see that, Class A office space has actually never been stronger. The best office space is actually sold out, because people are coming to the reciting to get people back in the office, and they want it to be nice. And then what I would also do is, even if you can't get everyone back in the office all the time, I would take some of the money you save from a smaller commercial footprint, and I would spend It on retreats where you get everyone together. I think it's just so important that people feel a sense of connective tissue, and I think they can only be established in person, but the bottom line is I think 80 to 90% of firms will end Up with some sort of hybrid structure.

During a bankruptcy, US exchanges use a liquidation process with asset values frozen at the time, in contrast to traditional brokerages converting assets back into local currency. Crypto exchanges serve as custodial accounts for assets rather than for immediate conversion into local currency like traditional trading accounts do.","Yeah, I think the plan is that that excess capital beyond what is, quote, owed to the account holders goes to the equity holders because it's considered excess of the liabilities. Therefore, it goes to the shareholders. I'll also say in a traditional like brokerage, you create an account. And when you set up an account, your account has a currency denomination. It's a dollar based account or a euro based account. And then you, your account holds a bunch of assets. And so at any given time, the value of your account is represented to you in that local currency. The challenge with crypto exchanges is that there's often this representation of a wallet, which is meant to hold assets that don't necessarily have the intention of being translated Into a locally denominated currency. And so I think that's what makes the system different. In the case of a US exchange bankruptcy, and this happens in commodity creating accounts or commodity exchanges often, there's a freezing of the assets and then a liquidation of the Assets where the freezing of the assets sets the price or the value at the moment of what you're supposed to hold in that account in your currency of your account. Right. And so the bankruptcy judge and the trustee are treating this like a liquidation process using a local currency that was set at the time, whereas many folks don't consider that the intention Of the account, that the account was meant to hold assets, that it's really a portfolio of assets that shouldn't be liquidated to try and generate local currency. Because that's kind of the whole point of many of these crypto currencies themselves.","Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the plan is that that excess capital beyond what is, quote, owed to the account holders goes to the equity holders because it's considered excess of the liabilities. Therefore, it goes to the shareholders. I'll also say in a traditional like brokerage, you create an account. And when you set up an account, your account has a currency denomination. It's a dollar based account or a euro based account. And then you, your account holds a bunch of assets. And so at any given time, the value of your account is represented to you in that local currency. The challenge with crypto exchanges is that there's often this representation of a wallet, which is meant to hold assets that don't necessarily have the intention of being translated Into a locally denominated currency."

Having a direct line to provide feedback and seeing tangible improvements based on that feedback can be viewed as a competitive advantage. Sharing milestones and successes can lead to warm leads, introductions to potential investors or customers, and overall increase opportunities for growth and success.","I actually think if you were deciding between a different software vendor and you're kind of like up in the air between two or three, being able to bet on trajectory and a person that you think actually has your best interest in heart and is trying much harder to make this work and succeed and that you have their ear directly to provide feedback, I actually think is a pretty key selling point. Whether it's the most scalable selling point is TBD, but I'm sure that there's plenty of people that I've DM with over the days that view it as a competitive advantage to be able to say, here's three things I think you can do better. And I have the track record of listening to them and delivering on those three things pretty quickly. And then lastly, when you hit milestones, it opens up a lot of doors. I don't have to share on Twitter and LinkedIn that we hit 3 million ARR, 4 million ARR, 5 million ARR. But when I do, I get dozens of warm leads from people who are like, hey, I've been following the journey. I think I'm moving off platform X to jump over to you or, hey, can I make an introduction to this investor, this advertiser, this newsletter, because I think they'd be a perfect fit. And I think it's just like maximizing your luck surface area. The more you can share, the more hype that you can build around the narrative that you're building on, the more opportunities and doors that open of people who either align with you and want to help you succeed, or at least just with the algorithms and everything else, being able to surface your success as a broader opportunity to whether it's investment is what you're going for or new customers.

These narratives fail to highlight the economic and social benefits immigrants bring to the society. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that immigrants have a net positive impact on the economy, with the children of immigrants climbing the economic ladder faster, many Fortune 500 companies founded by immigrants or their children, immigrants contributing significantly to US patents, and being more likely to start their own businesses compared to the native-born population.","Zeke Hernandez again. A lot of our national conversation about immigrants is framed around two narratives that both are incorrect and they do a lot of damage to us. Hernandez himself is an immigrant from Uruguay. He came here for college and stayed. I call one of them the villain narrative, which is the idea that immigrants hurt us because they steal our jobs. They threaten our national security.

This decline was exemplified by Argentina's shift in the early 1900s under Juan Perón, resulting in reduced immigrant influx and economic stagnation. Although the US followed a similar path at one point, its less dysfunctional political landscape may have prevented a decline as severe as Argentina's.","I don't think so, but I think it would be on its way to decline. In fact, I think a good historical parallel to the US, which even follows a lot of the same timeline, is Argentina. So in 1900, immigrants were equally likely to go to both places. So Italians would go as much to Buenos Aires as they would to New York because Argentina produced cars. Argentina had a thriving manufacturing industry. It was a country with a lot of very talented, educated people. Then the two countries diverged. A populist movement led by Juan Perón. Those are the people who know the musical. Evita's husband, Juan Perón, started a bunch of policies that were deeply protectionist and exclusionary. So Argentina stopped receiving as many immigrants. It turned inside economically. It started preventing foreign investment and ideas from coming in. I don't want to oversimplify. There's a lot of other differences between the US and Argentina since then. But Argentina has not fared well and kind of entered this consistent little by little economic decline to the point of being what it is today. And I think the US would have probably been similar, perhaps not as bad as what Argentina is because it politics were less dysfunctional, at least back then. But I think it's a good parallel.","I don't think so, but I think it would be on its way to decline.

The federal government benefits greatly from immigrants, with each immigrant providing a net tax benefit of around $260,000, totaling over $10 trillion in taxes collected over the years. However, states bear the costs of welcoming new immigrants without reimbursement, highlighting the disparity between federal benefits and state costs.","If you look in the long run, however, at the state level, those children that were expensive to immigrate, so that's now the second generation, contribute positively to the tune of $1,700 per immigrant and the grandchildren, the third generation, to the tune of 1,300 per immigrant. So if you added up over three generations, the gain for the second and third generation is $254 billion across all states versus a cost of $57 billion. So it's a positive return on investment, but it just takes a long time. And so I think the legitimate conversation is why is the federal government not reimbursing states for the costs that they bear to welcome new immigrants? The estimates show that the net benefit at the federal level, the net tax benefit of each immigrant is like $260,000. That adds up to over $10 trillion in taxes collected over many decades because of immigrants, but it's just that the federal government gets the benefits, states bear those costs unevenly, And there's no reimbursement scheme.","If you look in the long run, however, at the state level, those children that were expensive to immigrate, so that's now the second generation, contribute positively to the tune of $1,700 per immigrant and the grandchildren, the third generation, to the tune of 1,300 per immigrant.

Research after the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and studies on teenagers and mathematicians all point to lower wages in regions with more immigrants. Though some argue for complex factors offsetting this effect, the data highlights a significant impact on wages, particularly among the lowest education bracket in the US. A debate exists on the accuracy of the report's summary, with skeptics like George Borhaus claiming bias in downplaying the negative wage impact of immigration.","They created a table that reviewed all of the relevant studies to look at what the effect of immigration was on the wages of people already here. And it is dominated by negative numbers. The economic logic here is fairly straightforward when the supply of a good increases, all else equal, the price of that good tends to fall. And so when you look at individual studies, the aftermath of the 1994 Mexican peso crisis, which led to this burst of immigration here, it found that wages fared worse in regions of the US that had more people who were coming here because of the peso crisis. Another study has looked at teenagers and found that those who live in place with less immigration tend to work more and earn more. A particularly elegant, if narrow study looked at mathematicians and found that American born mathematicians fared really poorly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and all these Eastern European and Soviet mathematicians came into the country. It's a very basic concept, but a lot of advocates for immigration tend to dismiss it and say, no, no, there are all these other complex factors that erase that effect. And they can diminish that effect, but they don't erase it.","They created a table that reviewed all of the relevant studies to look at what the effect of immigration was on the wages of people already here. And it is dominated by negative numbers. The economic logic here is fairly straightforward when the supply of a good increases, all else equal, the price of that good tends to fall. And so when you look at individual studies, the aftermath of the 1994 Mexican peso crisis, which led to this burst of immigration here, it found that wages fared worse in regions of the US that had more people who were coming here because of the peso crisis.

Immigrants may take on tasks that do not require language skills, creating opportunities for natives to move into roles that demand English proficiency. This reallocation results in occupations that do not directly compete with each other. The complexity of immigration involves various inputs, outputs, conflicts between humanitarian and economic interests, and the tendency for individuals to cherry-pick facts for arguments.","The other is that even for jobs in which both immigrants and natives want to work, they bring different skill sets and play different roles or have different occupations. Let's say you have an immigrant in the construction field, that immigrant might not speak English very well. So that immigrant will end up doing the drywall work or the work that doesn't require language skills.

It requires straight understanding of where they're coming from, without the need for agreement. Empathy can be a powerful tool as it allows you to connect with and understand anyone, even if you do not sympathize or agree with them. It is important to show that you understand someone's perspective, regardless of your own views, in order to have a meaningful conversation and potentially bridge gaps of understanding.","So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric. The people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people. We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly. And I would say to them, you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that are anti-Islamic and they shake their head and go, yeah. And that'd be the start of the conversation. That's empathy. You believe this to be the case. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed. But I showed them that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs. I was so unafraid of them that I was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because I would say that and then I'd shut up and let them react. And I never had to say, here's why you're wrong. I never gave my point of view. Every single one of them are testified. That's empathy, not agreeing where the other side is coming from.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric.

Exhausting the other person or compromising does not lead to truth-seeking. In cases where the real truth is elusive, disagreeing and committing can be useful. Escalation to a higher authority for decision-making is preferred over a war of attrition. Decisiveness and moving forward swiftly on decisions contribute significantly to increasing velocity. Delayed decision-making is a common factor that impedes progress at all scales and fostering a culture of rapid decision-making is essential for achieving high velocity.","Do you want to get to the resolution as quickly as possible? Because that ultimately leads to a high velocity of the system.
Yes. And you want to try to get as close to truth as possible. So you want like exhausting the other person is not truth seeking. And compromise is not truth seeking. So it doesn't mean, now there are a lot of cases where no one knows the real truth. And that's where disagreeing and commit can come in. But escalation is better than war of attrition. Escalate to your boss and say, hey, we can't agree on this. We like each other. We're respectful of each other. But we strongly disagree with each other. We need you to make a decision here so we can move forward. But decisiveness, moving forward quickly on decisions, as quickly as you responsibly can, is how you increase velocity. Most of what slows things down is taking too long to make decisions at all scale levels. So it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity. Amazon has a million and a half people. And the company is still fast.",

Challenges to physicalism are seen in quantum mechanics, with concepts like entanglement and non-locality questioning traditional physicalist principles. 3.

As AI technology advances, high-status jobs like radiologists could be among the first to be replaced by AI. The focus will be on performance, and humans may become negligent if they do not utilize AI advancements to reduce risks, such as in autonomous driving. While making people smarter through AI assistance seems beneficial, current technology cannot replicate the free will and decision-making capabilities of humans. In the short term, the focus will be on making existing jobs more efficient. However, there are challenges in understanding and explaining AI algorithms, their brittleness, and vulnerability to attacks, which need to be addressed. In addition to economic impacts, national security, and job displacement, the dangers of misinformation, manipulation, and the creation of harmful tools and viruses by malicious actors need to be considered. It is necessary to have discussions about regulating AI use in social media to ensure the authenticity of human-generated content and limit the influence of AI-powered systems.",,"<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You can imagine, just in the limit, more and more getting seated to a i, because a i is just better at in these things. Its better at proving theorems. It's better at designing software. It's better, it's better, it's better. And all of a sudden, the need for human developers at all, or human mathematicians at all, or just make the list as long as you want. It seems like some of the the highest status jobs cognitively might be among the first to fall. Which is to say, i certainly expect, at this point, to have an a i radiologist, certainly before i have an a i plumber. And there's a lot more above and beyond the radiology side of that comparison that i think its going to fall before ine. Basic manual tasks fall to robots. And this, this is a picture of real success, right? Because in the end, all we're going to care about is performance. We're not going to care about keeping a a monkey in the loop just for reasons of sentimentality. You know, you're telling me that my car can drive a thousand times better than i can, which is to say that, you ow, is going to reduce my risk of getting in a fatal accident, ando killing Myself or killing someone else, by a factor of a thousand, if i just flip on autopilot. Well, then, not only am i going to flip it on, i'm going to consider anyone who declines to do that to be negligent to the point of criminality. And that's never going to change. Everything. Is going to be in the position of a current chess master who knows that the best player on earth is never going to be a person ever an, right? Because because of alpha zero. So, so i take tat warv.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I disagree a little bit, and i'll tell you why i think you're correct in about 30 years. But i don't think that argument is true in the short term.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Andyi know i was not. Itrest to beclare. I'm not suggesting any time frame there. I'm just saying, ultimately, if we continue to make progress, something like this seems bound to happen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But what i want to say is, i defy you to argue with me that making people smarter is a bad thing. So let's start with the premise of the human assistant. That is, e the thing that you're using will make humans smarter. It'll make it deeper, better analysis, better choices. But at least the current technology cannot replace the, essentially the free will of humans. They sort of wake up in the morning, you have a new idea, you decide something. You say, that's a bad idea, so fart and so on. We don't know how to do that yet. And and i've some speculation on how that will happen. But in the next decade, we're going to not be solving that problem. Weoud be solving a different problem, which is, how do we get the existing people doing existing jobs to do them more efficiently, that is, smarter, better, faster? One of the when we looked at the funding for this, a i programm that i've since announced, the funding the hundred 25 million, a fair chunk of it is going to really hard computer science Problems. Some of them include, we don't really understand how to explain what they're doing. As i mentioned, they 're all so brittle. They fail. They can fail catastrophically, like, why did it fail? And no one can explaino theyare hardening. There are resistance to attack problems. There are a number of problems of this kind. These are hard computer science problems, which i think we will get through. They use a lot of power. The algorithms are expensive, that sort of thing. But we have also focusing around the impact on jobs and employment in economics. Weare also focus on national security. And we're focusing on the question that you're asking, which is, what's our identity? What does it mean to be human? Before general intelligence comes, we have to deal with the fact that these systems are not capable of choosing their own outcome, but they can be applied to you as a citizen, by somebody Else, against your own satisfaction. So the ne es before a g i are all of the form misinformation, misleading information, creating dangerous tools. And for example, dangerous viruses. For the same reason that we built aa, fantastic new andebiotic drug, it looks like. You could also imagine a similar evil team of producing an incredible number of bad viruses, you know, things it would hurt people. And you could imagine, in that scenario, they might be clever enough to be able to hurt a particular race or particular sex, or something like that, which would be totally evil and obviously A very bad thing. We don't have a way of discussing that to day. So when i look at the positives and negatives right now, i think the positives, as with many technologies, really overwhelm the negatives. But the negatives need to be looked at. And we need to have the conversation right now about fruitless use social media, which is an easy whipping boy. Here i would like so i'm clear what my political position is. I am a very strong proponent of freedom of speech for humans. I am not in favor of freedom f speech for computers, robots, bots, silver and so on. I want an option with social media which says, i only want to see things that a human has actually communicated from themselves. I want to know that it wasn't snuck in by some russian agent. I want proof of providence, and i want to know that it's a human. And if it's a real human who's, in fact, you know, agent or crazier, whatever, i want be able to hear their voice, and i want to be able to decide i don't agree with it. What's happening instead is these systems are being boosted, they're being pitched, they're being sold by a i. And i think that's got to be limited in some way. I'm in favor of free speech, but i don't want, i don't want only some people to have megaphones.</blockquote>"

Vivek Ramaswamy Has a Different Vision for Trumpism From JD Vance,The Ezra Klein Show,New York Times Opinion,https://share.snipd.com/episode/eb00c007-319e-4920-aa67-d824d726c90f,2024-10-29,2024-12-24T14:55,"Vivek Ramaswamy burst onto the national scene last year as a wild card candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Here was a relatively unknown biotech executive with no political experience, pitching himself as someone who could carry on Donald Trump’s movement. Trump ultimately won that primary contest handily, but Ramaswamy was a breakout star. There was even chatter that he might be Trump’s V.P. pick. Trump, of course, ended up choosing JD Vance — Ramaswamy’s friend and former classmate — who has a very different vision for the future of Trumpism. But Ramaswamy believes the future of the Trump movement is still up for grabs and is fighting hard for his camp to win out over the one that Vance represents, including in his new book, 'Truths: The Future of America First.' In this conversation, we discuss the two competing visions that Ramaswamy sees as lurking beneath the surface of Trumpism, what he calls 'national protectionist' and 'national libertarian,' whether his vision is really so different from Paul Ryan-style conservativism, why he thinks these debates within the Republican Party are really deep down about identity and what it means to be an American.

The comparison between Sweden and the US reveals that there was not a significant difference in individual behavior guidance and enforcement. Sweden managed to avoid the predicted disaster due to natural advantages like lower international travel and high social trust. However, it is not a direct model for the US due to differences in complexity and management challenges between the two countries.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We told people that they shouldn't move around much or socialize. And then we didn't do much to enforce those rules. When you look at some of the data that's been examined by the Oxford Blavatnik School of Government, they've done an international comparative study of COVID mitigation measures. And they look at, I think it's like eight or 10 different categories of restrictions. Sweden is not unusually open in the spring and summer of 2020. It's a little bit more open than some of its European neighbors. It's about as open as the US is. And so their experience there was less confrontational. It was less patronizing in certain ways than the US was. But at the level of individual behavior and how it was guided and policed, I think there's actually considerably less difference between the two countries than we've told ourselves There was. And they had other natural advantages that they don't have a ton of people coming in and out of the country in the same way that the US does. They have high levels of social trust. All those things played a role too. But I think in the big picture, you'd have to say Sweden did not have the disaster that was predicted at the time. But it is also not necessarily a model for how a country like the US could operate in part because we're not so far from them and their policies as some of the Sweden advocates want to make Us believe. And in part because the US is just a different and more complicated country to manage than Sweden is.</blockquote>",

The change is attributed to the realization that earlier models were overly pessimistic about the growth of coal and the shift in the energy industry. Additionally, a global awakening at various levels has led to widespread acknowledgment of climate change and actions to limit emissions. While the possibility of higher warming levels still exists, it is no longer the baseline expectation.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would say right now most models suggest something between two and a half or three degrees assuming a continuation but not a rapid acceleration of today's climate policies. So whereas five years ago that expectation was for four to five, now we think something like two and a half to three, which means we've shaved a really large chunk of expected warming Off in a relatively short amount of time. We did that in a few different ways. Part of it was just that I think our earlier models were overly pessimistic about, for instance, the growth of coal over the course of the 21st century and the more that we've learned About the evolving shape of the energy industry, we've realized that not every poor country in the world is going to emulate the Chinese growth model of the 2000s and we're not going To end up with six or eight times as much coal use in 2100 as we have today. That's just not plausible. Part of it is that we've had a real global awakening at the grassroots level and at the political and geopolitical level such that there's very little true climate denial anymore, just About every leader, almost everywhere in the world acknowledges the reality of climate change and its challenges for his or her country and the globe. In many places they're taking action to limit emissions and therefore limit warming and other places much less so, but the net effect is that we expect considerably less warming than We, you know, in a sort of median conventional wisdom way than we expected five years ago. But that's not to say that warming of four or five degrees, which is what I was writing about five or seven years ago, is out of the question. It just requires us to get unlucky with some assumptions about the climate system rather than being a kind of a baseline expectation.</blockquote>",

But when I hear people arguing, you know, one side or the other, growth, de-growth, green growth, capitalism, socialism, you know, to me, it all seems too abstracted from the complexities And realities of the actual challenge of decarbonizing every single aspect of our modern world on the timeline of a generation or two, which is really what the climate crisis demands Of us.</blockquote>",

Donald Trump lost the election that year, but he made significant gains with nonwhite voters. At the time, a lot of Democrats saw that as a fluke, a hangover from Covid lockdown policies. But the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini saw it as bellwether. In his 2023 book, “Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP,” Ruffini argued that Trump was ushering in a party realignment. A trend that had been happening for years in the white electorate – college-educated voters moving to the left, and non-college-educated ones moving to the right – was now evident, he said, among voters of all races, breaking up the core of the Democratic base. And so far, the data we have from this election suggests that Ruffini was right. In this conversation, Ruffini contextualizes the 2024 election results by looking back at 2020’s.

There is not necessarily a sea change in economic condition, but there's a social component to this as well. It's sort of a cascade effect, right? When you have groups that have this, just this solid democratic group identity that is reinforced by political machines, and then it just seems like there's a tipping point at some Point where gradually people are moving, and then enough people move to where people kind of start looking around and saying, well, maybe I'm not alone. Maybe I can be more vocal about this. And you really saw that in 2020. You saw demonstrations of pro-Trump activity in a lot of these places where people would have been ostracized for saying they supported a Republican. And so I think it's more gradual shifts elsewhere...","Sort of rhetoric? There is not necessarily a sea change in economic condition, but there's a social component to this as well.

However, the dataset also contains information from really smart individuals, posing a challenge on how to prompt the AI to access this super genius part of the dataset. By crafting prompts differently, it can navigate to different parts of the data set, yielding varying responses. For instance, prompting the AI to write code will result in average code unless prompted differently.",,"<details>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and then there's a related question that comes up a lot. It's an argument we've been having internally, which is also start to take some sort of more provocative and probably more bullish, or as you would put it, sort of science fictiony predictions On some of this stuff. So there's this question that comes up, which is, okay, you take an L .M., you train it on the internet. What is the internet data? What is the internet data corpus? It's an average of everything, right? It's a representation of sort of human activity. Representation of human activity is going to kind of, you know, because of the sort of distribution of intelligence in the population, you know, most of it somewhere in the middle. And so the data set on average sort of represents the average human.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You're teaching it to be very average. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. You average. And so therefore the answer is our average, right? You're going to get back an answer that sort of represents the kind of thing that an average 100 IQ, you know, kind of by definition, the average human is 100 IQ, it's IQ is indexed to 100. That's the center of the bell curve. And so by definition, you're kind of getting back the average. I actually argue that may be the case for the default prompt today. You just ask the thing, does the Earth revolve around the sun or something? You get the average answer to that, and maybe that's fine. This gets to the point as, well, OK, the average data might be of an average person. But the data set also contains all of the things written and thought by all the really smart people. All that stuff is in there, and all the current people who are like that, their stuff is in there. And so then it's sort of like a prompting question, which is like, how do you prompt it in order to get basically, in order to basically navigate to a different part of what they call the Latent space, to navigate to a different part of the data set that basically is like the super genius part. And the way these things work is if you craft the prompt in a different way, it actually leads it down a different path inside the data set, gives you a different kind of answer. And here's another example of this. If you it, write code to do X, write code to sort of list or, you know, whatever, render an image, it will give you average code to do that.</blockquote>

This phenomenon occurs as companies innovate and improve software products, increasing customer satisfaction and creating a demand for more advanced features. Similar effects have been observed in other industries like Hollywood, where advancements like CGI have raised audience expectations, leading to more expensive movies.",,"<details>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so this is you see versions of this, for example, you build in your freeway and it actually makes traffic jams worse. Right. Because basically what happens is, oh, it's great. Now there's more roads. Now we can have more people live here. We can have more people that you know, we can make these companies bigger and others more traffic than ever. And now the traffic's even worse. Or you saw the classic example is during the Industrial Revolution, coal consumption as the price of coal drops. People use so much more coal that actually the overall consumption actually increased. People were getting a lot more power, but the result was the use of a lot more coal in the paradox. And so the paradox here would be, yes, the cost of developing any given piece of software falls, but the reaction to that is a massive surge of demand for software capabilities. And so the result of that actually is, although it even, it looks like starting software companies, the price is going to fall, actually it's going to happen, it's going to rise. For the high quality reason that you're going to be able to do so much more. Yeah. Right. With software, the products are going to be so much better and the roadmap is going to be so amazing of the things you can do and the customers are going to be so happy with it that they're Going to want more and more and more. Yeah. The result of it, and by the way, another example of Jevons Faradox playing out in another related industry is in Hollywood, CGI in theory should have reduced the price of making movies In reality has increased it because audience expectations went up. And now you go to a Hollywood movie and it's wall -to -wall CGI. And so movies are more expensive to make than ever.</blockquote>
