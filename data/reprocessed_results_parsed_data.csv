However, there are challenges in understanding and explaining AI algorithms, their brittleness, and vulnerability to attacks, which need to be addressed. In addition to economic impacts, national security, and job displacement, the dangers of misinformation, manipulation, and the creation of harmful tools and viruses by malicious actors need to be considered.

And all of a sudden, the need for human developers at all, or human mathematicians at all, or just make the list as long as you want.

And there's a lot more above and beyond the radiology side of that comparison that i think its going to fall before ine. Basic manual tasks fall to robots. And this, this is a picture of real success, right? Because in the end, all we're going to care about is performance. We're not going to care about keeping a a monkey in the loop just for reasons of sentimentality.

I'm just saying, ultimately, if we continue to make progress, something like this seems bound to happen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But what i want to say is, i defy you to argue with me that making people smarter is a bad thing. So let's start with the premise of the human assistant. That is, e the thing that you're using will make humans smarter. It'll make it deeper, better analysis, better choices. But at least the current technology cannot replace the, essentially the free will of humans. They sort of wake up in the morning, you have a new idea, you decide something. You say, that's a bad idea, so fart and so on. We don't know how to do that yet. And and i've some speculation on how that will happen. But in the next decade, we're going to not be solving that problem. Weoud be solving a different problem, which is, how do we get the existing people doing existing jobs to do them more efficiently, that is, smarter, better, faster? One of the when we looked at the funding for this, a i programm that i've since announced, the funding the hundred 25 million, a fair chunk of it is going to really hard computer science Problems. Some of them include, we don't really understand how to explain what they're doing. As i mentioned, they 're all so brittle. They fail. They can fail catastrophically, like, why did it fail? And no one can explaino theyare hardening. There are resistance to attack problems. There are a number of problems of this kind. These are hard computer science problems, which i think we will get through. They use a lot of power. The algorithms are expensive, that sort of thing. But we have also focusing around the impact on jobs and employment in economics. Weare also focus on national security. And we're focusing on the question that you're asking, which is, what's our identity? What does it mean to be human? Before general intelligence comes, we have to deal with the fact that these systems are not capable of choosing their own outcome, but they can be applied to you as a citizen, by somebody Else, against your own satisfaction. So the ne es before a g i are all of the form misinformation, misleading information, creating dangerous tools. And for example, dangerous viruses. For the same reason that we built aa, fantastic new andebiotic drug, it looks like. You could also imagine a similar evil team of producing an incredible number of bad viruses, you know, things it would hurt people. And you could imagine, in that scenario, they might be clever enough to be able to hurt a particular race or particular sex, or something like that, which would be totally evil and obviously A very bad thing. We don't have a way of discussing that to day. So when i look at the positives and negatives right now, i think the positives, as with many technologies, really overwhelm the negatives. But the negatives need to be looked at. And we need to have the conversation right now about fruitless use social media, which is an easy whipping boy. Here i would like so i'm clear what my political position is. I am a very strong proponent of freedom of speech for humans. I am not in favor of freedom f speech for computers, robots, bots, silver and so on. I want an option with social media which says, i only want to see things that a human has actually communicated from themselves. I want to know that it wasn't snuck in by some russian agent. I want proof of providence, and i want to know that it's a human. And if it's a real human who's, in fact, you know, agent or crazier, whatever, i want be able to hear their voice, and i want to be able to decide i don't agree with it. What's happening instead is these systems are being boosted, they're being pitched, they're being sold by a i. And i think that's got to be limited in some way. I'm in favor of free speech, but i don't want, i don't want only some people to have megaphones.</blockquote>"
