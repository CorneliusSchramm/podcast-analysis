However, the dataset also contains information from really smart individuals, posing a challenge on how to prompt the AI to access this super genius part of the dataset. By crafting prompts differently, it can navigate to different parts of the data set, yielding varying responses. For instance, prompting the AI to write code will result in average code unless prompted differently.",,"<details>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and then there's a related question that comes up a lot. It's an argument we've been having internally, which is also start to take some sort of more provocative and probably more bullish, or as you would put it, sort of science fictiony predictions On some of this stuff. So there's this question that comes up, which is, okay, you take an L .M., you train it on the internet. What is the internet data? What is the internet data corpus? It's an average of everything, right? It's a representation of sort of human activity. Representation of human activity is going to kind of, you know, because of the sort of distribution of intelligence in the population, you know, most of it somewhere in the middle. And so the data set on average sort of represents the average human.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You're teaching it to be very average. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. You average. And so therefore the answer is our average, right? You're going to get back an answer that sort of represents the kind of thing that an average 100 IQ, you know, kind of by definition, the average human is 100 IQ, it's IQ is indexed to 100. That's the center of the bell curve. And so by definition, you're kind of getting back the average. I actually argue that may be the case for the default prompt today. You just ask the thing, does the Earth revolve around the sun or something? You get the average answer to that, and maybe that's fine. This gets to the point as, well, OK, the average data might be of an average person. But the data set also contains all of the things written and thought by all the really smart people. All that stuff is in there, and all the current people who are like that, their stuff is in there. And so then it's sort of like a prompting question, which is like, how do you prompt it in order to get basically, in order to basically navigate to a different part of what they call the Latent space, to navigate to a different part of the data set that basically is like the super genius part. And the way these things work is if you craft the prompt in a different way, it actually leads it down a different path inside the data set, gives you a different kind of answer. And here's another example of this. If you it, write code to do X, write code to sort of list or, you know, whatever, render an image, it will give you average code to do that.</blockquote>

This phenomenon occurs as companies innovate and improve software products, increasing customer satisfaction and creating a demand for more advanced features. Similar effects have been observed in other industries like Hollywood, where advancements like CGI have raised audience expectations, leading to more expensive movies.",,"<details>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so this is you see versions of this, for example, you build in your freeway and it actually makes traffic jams worse. Right. Because basically what happens is, oh, it's great. Now there's more roads. Now we can have more people live here. We can have more people that you know, we can make these companies bigger and others more traffic than ever. And now the traffic's even worse. Or you saw the classic example is during the Industrial Revolution, coal consumption as the price of coal drops. People use so much more coal that actually the overall consumption actually increased. People were getting a lot more power, but the result was the use of a lot more coal in the paradox. And so the paradox here would be, yes, the cost of developing any given piece of software falls, but the reaction to that is a massive surge of demand for software capabilities. And so the result of that actually is, although it even, it looks like starting software companies, the price is going to fall, actually it's going to happen, it's going to rise. For the high quality reason that you're going to be able to do so much more. Yeah. Right. With software, the products are going to be so much better and the roadmap is going to be so amazing of the things you can do and the customers are going to be so happy with it that they're Going to want more and more and more. Yeah. The result of it, and by the way, another example of Jevons Faradox playing out in another related industry is in Hollywood, CGI in theory should have reduced the price of making movies In reality has increased it because audience expectations went up. And now you go to a Hollywood movie and it's wall -to -wall CGI. And so movies are more expensive to make than ever.</blockquote>
