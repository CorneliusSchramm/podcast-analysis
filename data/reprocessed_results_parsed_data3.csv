Vivek Ramaswamy Has a Different Vision for Trumpism From JD Vance,The Ezra Klein Show,New York Times Opinion,https://share.snipd.com/episode/eb00c007-319e-4920-aa67-d824d726c90f,2024-10-29,2024-12-24T14:55,"Vivek Ramaswamy burst onto the national scene last year as a wild card candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Here was a relatively unknown biotech executive with no political experience, pitching himself as someone who could carry on Donald Trump’s movement. Trump ultimately won that primary contest handily, but Ramaswamy was a breakout star. There was even chatter that he might be Trump’s V.P. pick. Trump, of course, ended up choosing JD Vance — Ramaswamy’s friend and former classmate — who has a very different vision for the future of Trumpism. But Ramaswamy believes the future of the Trump movement is still up for grabs and is fighting hard for his camp to win out over the one that Vance represents, including in his new book, 'Truths: The Future of America First.' In this conversation, we discuss the two competing visions that Ramaswamy sees as lurking beneath the surface of Trumpism, what he calls 'national protectionist' and 'national libertarian,' whether his vision is really so different from Paul Ryan-style conservativism, why he thinks these debates within the Republican Party are really deep down about identity and what it means to be an American.

This shift represents progress as individuals of diverse backgrounds and professions are now involved in analyzing news and discussing intellectual topics. This change contrasts with the more business-focused culture of the past, where even the elite were not engaging in such intellectual activities. Nowadays, it is considered part of the norm for educated individuals to perceive themselves as thinkers actively deciphering the state of the world and predicting future trends.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you can see certain algorithmic problems when you're looking at, you know, Twitter or TikTok. But when you look at what's happening on YouTube or in podcasts, it seems to me like we just have a huge new population of people who demographically and professionally a half-generation Ago would not have been really intellectuals. Now playing the role of intellectuals in public, but also many of them just processing news from the world on their own. And you know, on some level, that has to be progress and it has to be a good thing. When I think about, you know, just imagining the equivalent, like Silicon Valley elite from 20 years ago, they were just not, you know, listening to three-hour podcasts about, you Know, some 17th century event or like, you know, the path of the plague through Europe or whatever it is. It just was a very different kind of more business-centered culture. And that's true of more traditional business centers too. And now I think almost everyone of some education and sort of status, it thinks of themselves as a thinker and thinks of part of their job as figuring out the state of the world and the future.</blockquote>",

The comparison between Sweden and the US reveals that there was not a significant difference in individual behavior guidance and enforcement. Sweden managed to avoid the predicted disaster due to natural advantages like lower international travel and high social trust. However, it is not a direct model for the US due to differences in complexity and management challenges between the two countries.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We told people that they shouldn't move around much or socialize. And then we didn't do much to enforce those rules. When you look at some of the data that's been examined by the Oxford Blavatnik School of Government, they've done an international comparative study of COVID mitigation measures. And they look at, I think it's like eight or 10 different categories of restrictions. Sweden is not unusually open in the spring and summer of 2020. It's a little bit more open than some of its European neighbors. It's about as open as the US is. And so their experience there was less confrontational. It was less patronizing in certain ways than the US was. But at the level of individual behavior and how it was guided and policed, I think there's actually considerably less difference between the two countries than we've told ourselves There was. And they had other natural advantages that they don't have a ton of people coming in and out of the country in the same way that the US does. They have high levels of social trust. All those things played a role too. But I think in the big picture, you'd have to say Sweden did not have the disaster that was predicted at the time. But it is also not necessarily a model for how a country like the US could operate in part because we're not so far from them and their policies as some of the Sweden advocates want to make Us believe. And in part because the US is just a different and more complicated country to manage than Sweden is.</blockquote>",

The change is attributed to the realization that earlier models were overly pessimistic about the growth of coal and the shift in the energy industry. Additionally, a global awakening at various levels has led to widespread acknowledgment of climate change and actions to limit emissions. While the possibility of higher warming levels still exists, it is no longer the baseline expectation.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would say right now most models suggest something between two and a half or three degrees assuming a continuation but not a rapid acceleration of today's climate policies. So whereas five years ago that expectation was for four to five, now we think something like two and a half to three, which means we've shaved a really large chunk of expected warming Off in a relatively short amount of time. We did that in a few different ways. Part of it was just that I think our earlier models were overly pessimistic about, for instance, the growth of coal over the course of the 21st century and the more that we've learned About the evolving shape of the energy industry, we've realized that not every poor country in the world is going to emulate the Chinese growth model of the 2000s and we're not going To end up with six or eight times as much coal use in 2100 as we have today. That's just not plausible. Part of it is that we've had a real global awakening at the grassroots level and at the political and geopolitical level such that there's very little true climate denial anymore, just About every leader, almost everywhere in the world acknowledges the reality of climate change and its challenges for his or her country and the globe. In many places they're taking action to limit emissions and therefore limit warming and other places much less so, but the net effect is that we expect considerably less warming than We, you know, in a sort of median conventional wisdom way than we expected five years ago. But that's not to say that warming of four or five degrees, which is what I was writing about five or seven years ago, is out of the question. It just requires us to get unlucky with some assumptions about the climate system rather than being a kind of a baseline expectation.</blockquote>",

A successful transition requires a diverse coalition that includes both revolutionary energy and market-oriented approaches. Achieving a balance between heavy-handed government intervention and enabling market forces is essential. The complexity of decarbonization demands a pragmatic approach rather than abstract debates between growth and de-growth, capitalism and socialism. The focus should be on the practical challenges of decarbonization on a significant timeline.","<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But I also don't want to say to those people who see things in those terms, or for that matter, for those people who think that the whole transition will be engineered by markets, that They're entirely wrong either. I think that we fall into traps of opposition when what we're really talking about is, you know, trying to steer a really big ship of state in the right direction. And, you know, I don't think we're going to get revolution. So I don't think it's even worth talking about. But I'm happy to have people with some revolutionary energy on that boat. And I'm also happy to have some people who really think that the markets are powerful on that boat. Because if we really want to make a change, we kind of need the biggest tent we can imagine. And we probably need a lot of policies that come from some pretty heavy-handed government intervention. And some policies that really enable market forces to flourish too. Hopefully we can kind of find a balance. But when I hear people arguing, you know, one side or the other, growth, de-growth, green growth, capitalism, socialism, you know, to me, it all seems too abstracted from the complexities And realities of the actual challenge of decarbonizing every single aspect of our modern world on the timeline of a generation or two, which is really what the climate crisis demands Of us.</blockquote>",
