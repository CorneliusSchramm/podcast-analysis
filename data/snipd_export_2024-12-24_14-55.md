**Exceptional Period of Stability Ending**

- The post-WWII era until recent times (9/11, Trump, Ukraine war) was exceptionally stable, with global leaders sharing similar worldviews.
- This period, a "great liberal reformation," saw advancements in various areas, but its end marks a return to historical norms with multiple competing powers.

<blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>But I think the thing to understand at the moment is how exceptional the period that we were living through, that we grew up in, was. How extraordinary. And of course, we didn't realize it when we were in it so much. But the period from 45, 48, 50, to, okay, 9-11, or the election of Donald Trump, or whatever, you know, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even October 7th. How exceptional was that period where, you know, the leaders of, actually, you know, every president of the United States had kind of similar views of the world, you know, give or take Small differences. They had a view of an internationalist view of a mission to the world. And where Soviet leaders, despite believing in world revolution, and their mission to change the world, were also extremely conservative, really. And where, you know, people did respect the United Nations, that was a supranational sanctuary of something called international law, which existed because people believed it existed. And where various views became taboo in most liberal democracies, anti-Semitism, where a great liberal reformation happened with gay rights. And that another advance is the pill, the right to abortion. All these things were kind of won in this kind of period, which I call in my world history, the great liberal reformation, because it was so radical. But of course, we took it for granted. And all, of course, all of these things will have to be fought for again and are now under threat. And that exceptional period, it's hard to think of a period where anything like that really existed. You know, maybe the Roman Empire, when the Roman Empire faced the Persians and the Sasanians, there were these kind of, you know, two polar powers that really kind of kept a sort of peace. But of course, it was a much more brutal, brutal world. And of course, the rest of the world was not included in those two powers. It was really just Mediterranean and the Near East.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>So the end of this world is a sort of return to the way things have always been with massive number of powers.

### [41:21] Origin of Antisemitism

**Origin of Antisemitism**

- Many Jews initially rejected Jesus's teachings.
-  Antisemitism emerged when Christianity became the Roman state religion under Constantine the Great, as Jews' resistance was seen as a political and religious insult.

<blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>But you're right, from the beginning, many Jews rejected the revelation of Jesus, and the position was fine as long as Christianity didn't become a state religion. But when it became a state religion with Constantine the Great, then the existence of the Jews, which had been tolerated perfectly happily under the Roman Empire, providing that they Didn't rebel politically, they were regarded as somewhat strange, believing in only one God. But because they were very ancient, they were respected. But when they resisted the new faith of the Roman Empire, newly converted, then they began to be regarded as a sort of political and religious insult, as you said. And so it's really from that period that antisemitism really started in the Byzantine official state policy, which actually became more and more anti-Jewish. And it was they who specifically, the Eastern Roman Empire, we called them the Byzantines later, but they called themselves Romans, Romaioi, they were Greek speaking, and they ruled From Constantinople. And they passed a series of increasingly stringent anti-Jewish laws, which in many ways are the sort of basis for much of anti-Semitism, the persecution of Jews, the banning of religion, That they were no longer allowed to own property, and they were not allowed onto the Temple Mount. And there are scenes that St.</blockquote>

**Jewish Otherness**

- Jews' written history and ancient traditions defined them clearly, setting them apart.
- This distinct identity, while preserving their heritage, also made them a target for prejudice and suspicion.

<blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>And I think it was because the Jews had a written history that defined them so clearly. And they were the only people to do so in such an ancient tradition that they were able to do so. But it also made them obnoxious to many people, that living rebuke. But also the presence in societies that were totally Christian made their otherness seem alien, seem dangerous even. And in societies that couldn't explain scientific phenomenon, pestilence, plagues, and so on, they looked at the foreigner, the outsider, the alien, to blame for that. And many of the tropes of antisemitism come from that. You know, the idea of Jews, which the Nazis took up as a bacteria in a healthy society, for example. The murder of a child in a town could lead to accusations of the blood libel, you know, as happened in British cities, in English cities. And these merged with the fact that they were clearly foreign people in the midst of a country of overwhelming.</blockquote>

**Crusader Massacre in Jerusalem**

- During the First Crusade, a small group of crusaders, aided by Italian sailors, stormed Jerusalem in July 1099.
- They massacred almost the entire population of about 20,000 people, including the Fatimid garrison and Arab, Turkish, and Jewish inhabitants.

<blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>And then they fought their way all the way around the eastern Mediterranean. And a tiny, tiny number of that 100 or 120,000 people arrived outside Jerusalem in July 1099. There may have been as few as 12,000 crusaders made it there. And with the help of Italian sailors who dismantled their boats at Jaffa and brought the wood across the relatively short distance to Jerusalem and built siege machines. They stormed Jerusalem on the 15th of July. And the population of Jerusalem, it's always described as sort of 70,000, 100,000, it's probably much less, it was probably 20,000. And that included a Fatimid Egyptian garrison and governor, and then an Arab, Turkish, and Jewish population. And it's often forgotten that when they took the city, they massacred everybody they found in Jerusalem, except people they could identify as very wealthy with connections to Cairo. And they were ransomed. So very few, luckily, were survived. But virtually everybody in that 20,000 were killed in cold blood. And the sources say that there was so much blood that the horses rode up to their bridles in blood. And when they made it to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, they were just covered in blood. They were just drenched in blood. And they</blockquote>

**The Crusades and October 7th**

- The Crusaders' massacre in Jerusalem in 1099, where they killed almost everyone, stands out for its brutality.
- Simon Sebag Montefiore finds this chilling event echoed in the violence of October 7th, which he considers more similar to a Christian crusade than traditional Islamic conquest.

<blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>So a chilling moment. And it's perhaps an interesting point to make. It's so destructive in the way that they massacred everybody in this kind of spectacular, ostentatious killing that the one modern event that reminds me of it is October the 7th. You know, more than any other, funny enough. And of course, that comes to the nature of October the 7th, which in many ways is alien to Arab and Islamic culture in the long reach of history. Where, you know, actually, when Saladin retook Jerusalem in 1187, there was no massacre. Jews were settled in the city again. And that's tradition of Islam that is utterly admirable. So what does October the 7th, it's interesting that October the 7th is more similar to a Christian storming of Jerusalem than anything else. And that comes to the nature of Islamism, of Hamas's Islamism, which is a very recent invention in Islam. And Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that was invented by El Banner in Egypt in 1928. And the other half of its peculiar genocidal racism is, of course, totally based on Nazism, on European fascism, European racism. So its foreignness to the region is not so surprising.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Yeah, well, there's a lot there.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>The population that I think is most tired of theocracy is the Iranian population, right? I mean, Iran, the republic, the theocracy on top of the population is responsible for much, even most of the mayhem in the Middle East at the moment. But the people in Iran really sound like they're ready to be done with the theocrats. A hundred percent.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>And I think that regime is deeply repressive to its own people. But more than that, its foreign policy has been, well, apart from being the most successful Persian state since the Sasanians in the 7th century, probably, or certainly since the 18th Century of Nadir Shah, they were able to extend their power using proxies all the way to the Mediterranean, which is extraordinary, through Iraq, through Syria, through Lebanon, And an astounding success. And something that actually the United States, when we write the history of the early 21st century, United States foreign policy may look upon allowing that as one of the most grievous Mistakes of the last</blockquote>

**Misinformation and Good Intentions**

- Some liberal Westerners are susceptible to misinformation that paints Israel as a colonialist state and Jews as white oppressors.
- This view, though genealogically inaccurate, maps the American civil rights movement onto the Middle East, casting Arabs as black and Jews as white, leading to misplaced blame for the region's issues.

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>That the Jews are colonialists and that Israel as a state is a vestige of imperialism, and that Jews are the white people in the region, as confused as that is genealogically, that's The belief. And therefore, you get this sort of mapping, especially in an American context, of the American civil rights movement, and it's all the history it has to apologize for. You map that onto the Middle East, the Arabs are effectively black and the Jews are effectively white. And here we get some sort of post-Reconstruction, lingering supremacy and an apartheid-like unfairness that has to be accounted for and changed. The status quo in the region is insufferable, and all the onus seems to fall on the Jewish side. Again, this is a powerful species of confusion, but it's not anti-Semitism of a sort that we tend to think about. And yet at its core, obviously, there's a fair amount of anti-Semitism and</blockquote>

**Modern Anti-Semitism**

-  Post-October 7th, anti-Semitism surged, fueled by misinformation and misapplication of Western ideologies.
- Progressive ideals, combined with historical anti-Semitic tropes, created a new form of anti-Semitism disguised as anti-racism.

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>I realize I've given you a very unbalanced and chaotic object to interact with here, but how do you view the eruption of anti-Semitism post-October 7th? And what do you think we do about it?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Well, I mean, I think first of all, it was just an extraordinary thing. And it was a terrible shock. And I think to see, you know, the day after or the day of, you know, this, this slaughter, this rapine, this hunt for human trophies, to see people on, on university campuses, people we Respected, celebrating was a terrifying and tragic moment. And I think, among other things, for Jewish people, just in Jewish history, I think what we saw, and events since then in the last year have confirmed this, the sort of end of the golden Age of Jewish, of tolerance for Jewish, of Jewish life in the West, and nothing less than that, which is, which is, which is a tragedy. One can now see there was a sort of golden age after World War II, after 1948, that really endured until pretty recently. And I think we didn't realize how much we had ceded power in our universities, for example, to ideologies that we really didn't understand or notice for that matter or care about that Much, and that they developed without us really understanding them or taking the trouble to judge. And so, you know, you described, I guess, the essence of one part of it, which is the progressive part where the American civil rights movement, the idea of racial identity, the history Of race, the tortured history of race and slavery in American history was applied to the Middle East, a complicated cosmopolitan, multi-faith, multi-ethnic region that really had No parallel whatsoever to the experience of African-Americans and enslavement in America at all, but which was an ideology that became a dominant stream of thought, a lens through Which to judge the world. And of course, that civil rights ideology was then was also merged with the struggle ideology of decolonization, which justified any resistance against the heirs of Western criminal Empire building in history. But to look at all this and apply all this to the creation of Israel and the creation of the Middle East requires not just misguided good intentions, but also a grotesque lack of knowledge Of what really happened. And I mean, the interesting thing is that not all of it was, as you say, traditional antisemitism in terms of things like the blood libel or the master race that the Nazis believed in. So there wasn't the sort of blatant racism that you might have found in 13th century Lincoln or 1930s Berlin. But it was very quickly, those tropes and images and traditions that were buried deep in Western culture were dug out and deployed to support an ideology that was initially probably Well-intentioned and based on ignorance. And we've now seen the merging of those two things and do so all the time from both the far right and progressive people. One of the strange inheritances of the wonderful period between the 40s and the early 21st century, when anti-Semitism was a taboo in most societies in the world. One of the great hangovers from that was a sort of formal anti-racism, in which you could say anything, providing you said you were also anti-racist. And part of that was the cult of the Holocaust, which has in many ways, in what I call a sort of terrifying dark mirroring, being used against Jewish people and against Israel. And I don't think Israel is complete, I don't think Israeli leaders have actually been wise in their overuse of this imagery either. And I think they must take some blame for extremely coarse and short-sighted overuse of these ideas as well. And they have to bear some responsibility. But overall, the merging of medieval antisemitism, 19th century and early 20th century antisemitism, with progressive decolonization, has created a sort of extraordinary new Version of anti-Semitism that is self-described as anti-racist, but is in fact highly racist. And one of the most disgusting parts of it, to me as a historian, is, as I said, the dark mirroring, the inversion of Jewish history to be used against Jews. And it started early in the 21st century with the claim that Gaza was like the Warsaw Ghetto, for example. So that strain of thinking, of course, started in the Soviet Union as a deliberate anti-American, anti-Zionist ideology in the late 50s and early 60s, and was written about in policy Papers promoted by gifted Soviet leaders like Yuri Andropov, who ran the KGB for a long time, was chairman of the KGB for a long time, and was secretly Jewish, it turns out, interestingly. And of course, that was, and from that, it was, that idea was spread in Soviet propaganda to many of the liberation movements whose successors rule places like South Africa, which is Why the ANC, for example, has adopted this view and also adopted a very pro-Russian policy in the Ukraine, for example. So that was the origin of these sort of meandering strains of thought. But the misuse of Jewish history and Jewish suffering against Jews today is a thoroughly disgusting form of this modern antisemitism. And you regularly see Jews described as sort of having massive power in the media or massive power over American society now without much challenge. So that's one part of it. So there's this myth of Jewish power, there's dark Jewish history inverted so that Palestinians become the Jews in this story, or the African Americans in this story. And of course, as you said, that requires this preposterous leap and the judgment of Jews in Western societies as a privileged elite, too privileged to suffer racism, and</blockquote>

**Double Standards and Israel**

- Israel faces double standards, with a focus on Palestinian refugees but ignoring Jewish refugees from Arab lands.
- Israel's adherence to modern warfare contrasts sharply with its enemies' use of human shields.

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>What you have is Israel isolated by a widespread application of double standards, right? So you have this perpetual focus on the Palestinians as refugees and displaced people who should have a right of return, and you have no thought given whatsoever to the right of return Of all the Jews who are run out of Iraq and Syria and Libya and all the surrounding countries. There's no thought to that. There's no thought to the fact that in their prosecution of their wars, the Israelis hold themselves to a standard of modern combat and the minimization of collateral damage that is Not only unthinkable in the populations they're fighting, they're fighting people who use their own civilians as human shields, right? I mean, so everything is upside down with respect to the response to these differences. And inconveniently for us in describing these double standards, it begins to sound like an allegation of a widespread conspiracy theory, because, as you just said, so much of this Has been engineered consciously by Russian misinformation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Want to return to one point you raised. I realize we're getting to the end of our hour here, Simon, and it's been wonderful to get your views on everything top to bottom here. But I just want to sharpen up one point that you touched on just in passing, and you said something about the golden age for Jews having passed. Many of us in America look at Western Europe and wonder whether life for Jews there is fast becoming untenable due to the failures of assimilation of so many Muslim immigrants who, in What proportion that remains to be seen, but in a proportion that is both and dangerous, seem committed to some form of Islamist slash jihadist way of life there. And, you know, out of that falls a fairly murderous anti-Semitism. What's your view of the prospects for Judaism in Europe at this point? Is there another diaspora in the making?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Do you know, I think that Jews will have a future in the liberal democracies. And I think that if you look at societies like Britain, for example, the divisions are hugely exaggerated between different ethnic groups, different religions in Britain. I mean, when you walk the streets of London, you see such an amazing cosmopolitan world. And there is something to be said for that argument that these sort of stresses most intensify when real mixing and real cosmopolitanism is actually thriving in a way. So I think, I don't feel as that, you know, we're living on the side, on the edge of a volcano.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>But what I do feel is- And can you say that, are you including in that analysis all the countries in Western Europe, like France and Belgium and- All of them have followed slightly different</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Policies in creating, and some of them have created, you more divided societies than we have in Britain. And, you know, what we saw in Amsterdam, for example, the other day, was extremely alarming. And when one looks at that event, as so often in our conversation tonight or today, you know, you have to be able to hold two thoughts in your own mind. I mean, in Amsterdam, for example, you have to be able to recognize that, first of all, some Israeli soccer hooligans, like soccer hooligans everywhere, like the factions that supported The chariot teams in ancient Constantinople. Some of them are complete thugs. And some of them acted in a thuggish way and did tear down Palestinian flags and what have you. What happened the next day was equally undeniably an organized pogrom, organized on social media and hunting Jews through the streets of Amsterdam. And both these things can be true and were true. And that does reflect a crisis in Dutch society that I'm not an expert on. And so I would be careful what I said about it, but it does seem to reflect some sort of crisis in society. And I just go back to what I said, and this is what we've, we in civil society now have a big task in America and in the Western world. One thing is not to tolerate views that are based on twisted ideologies in our institutions. We've let them get this far. And if necessary, civil society must ultimately gather itself and withdraw support, even from great institutions, be it Harvard or whatever, even the BBC, if they're incapable of Separating themselves from really toxic distortions and forms of racism. But at the same time, we've got to give courage to our political leadership, not to be bullied by these relatively small groups of people. And I think, you know, there's nothing wrong if there are a few streets of people who have obnoxious views in a Western city. That shouldn't be allowed to intimidate any section of society or an elected leadership of political leaders we have elected in order to keep us safe. After all, that's the entire point of why states were formed, why we elect people in the first place. If they can't do that, then they're not doing their job. But the right of small groups of people in Western societies to hold appallingly views. They have every right to hold those views, but not to intimidate others. And that's where the line comes. And, you know, I just go back to saying that our societies need to regain their confidence in themselves. Our leaders need to be, we need to reward leaders who take these people on and who don't tolerate utterly intolerant racist views in any part of society, be wherever it is, then there's No problem. Because the number of people who hold these views are actually very small. Even in all communities, there are very, very small minority. But of course, as always happens in history, when it looks at revolutions, revolutions and radical changes made by very small groups of dedicated vanguardists. As Lenin wrote about in What Is To Be Done, I think in 1903 or 1904, whenever he wrote it, he spotted the essence of political power is dedicated small groups. And that's what's happened. Small groups of people that can produce big crowds in our streets.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>That really does cut both ways. I mean, I hear, I'm comforted by the knowledge that it's such a small group of people who are very loud. And yet, when you look at instances in history, like the Russian Revolution and Lenin's part in it, you can see what very small committed groups of people can accomplish when everyone Else is silent.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>And that brings us back to the fact that, but yes, the golden era of Jewish life, when the whole of society would unite immediately to stop these sort of threats is over. And I think that it's alarmist to say we're in the 1930s. I mean, I think that we, I feel that we're more like going to have to exist in a world rather like the sort of late 19th century, where our safety is assured most of the time. But there are dangerous incidents which are very frightening, and we have to be ready for those. But those are things that were unthinkable in the golden age of Judaism and of Jewry. And that tragically died on October the 7th and 8th. But I do think civil society, at some point, something will happen and civil society will empower politicians and empower its donors, its own activists, to</blockquote>

And that does reflect a crisis in Dutch society that I'm not an expert on. And so I would be careful what I said about it, but it does seem to reflect some sort of crisis in society.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Jason Calacanis</b><br/><br/>So, you know, that's really where these hurricanes are coming from. Now, they're going to be more frequent if the ocean temperatures remain elevated as they seem to be, and continue to be elevated. And this can be a function of generally, the temperatures warming on Earth, generally, the removal of sulfur dioxide, generally, these El Ni√±o La Ni√±a cycles. There's a lot of factors, but it seems to be the case that we are having a very significant trend of continuously warmer oceans. And those continuously warmer oceans means that we're going to have what used to be called a one in 500 year storm, which is what Asheville is being termed at, one in 500 year. These sorts of storm events can happen every couple years. And we're now looking at one in 100 year events happening every two to three years in the United States with the activity that we've been seeing.</blockquote>

### [17:38] Florida's state reinsurance fund is effectively bankrupt, unable to cover potential hurricane losses.

- Florida's state reinsurance fund is effectively bankrupt, unable to cover potential hurricane losses.
- The situation raises questions about federal intervention and sets a problematic precedent for other disaster-prone states.

<blockquote><b>Jason Calacanis</b><br/><br/>So the state over the last several years has had to step in and effectively subsidize the insurance. And now the state reinsurance vehicle only has statutory liability maximum of $17 billion in a single hurricane season. Now, I think they got lucky with Milton today, but some were estimating that the Milton losses were going to be in excess of $100 billion, bigger than Katrina. It's likely, as of this morning, the reinsurance websites are all saying it's probably a $40 to $50 billion loss event, which still exceeds the state's reinsurance capacity. So you can kind of think about Florida State's reinsurance thing being effectively bankrupt. It doesn't really have the capacity to underwrite the insurance anymore. So the real question for everyone is, is the federal government going to have to step in and start to support the price of homes? Because if they don't...</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>Well, it's a terrible precedent to set because if you do it for Florida, then you'll have to do it in Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi. And California with wildfires. And California and Arizona and Texas. There's going to be no way to create a clear demarcation of who gets a bailout and who doesn't, which will mean that everybody will get a bailout or nobody gets a bailout. That's right.</blockquote>

**Regulation Stifles Growth**

- US economic growth is hampered by accumulating federal regulations with no expiry dates. 
- Friedberg believes the US economy could grow much faster without this regulatory burden.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>None of these regulations have expiry dates. And so as a result, I think what you probably have is an incredible restraint on the US economy. I think that the US economy could be growing at four or five percent. But the reason that it doesn't grow at four or five percent is in that one single chart, It is impossible to be able to live up to your economic potential when you have this burden on your Neck. So I think the real opportunity for Doge is to basically do whatever it needs to do using the law to wipe as many of these regulations off the books. We are better cutting them all to zero and then finding the ones we really need and then repassing those than we are going at this piecemeal. And there's some incredible</blockquote>

**Bureaucracy Growth**

- Organizations, including government agencies, have a natural tendency to expand.
-  Individuals within these organizations strive for greater influence and responsibility, leading to increased regulation and expansion.

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>About this many times, many times in the past, but like all organizations have a natural tendency to grow. They want to grow. They're not like, find me one nonprofit or find me one university or find me one company or one government agency that's ever said, my job is to shrink myself. It's never happened. So why does that happen? Well, if you look at the like, day to day operating role of each individual, over time, like all individuals, they want to do more, they want to have a bigger impact, they want to have more Scale, they want to have more leverage. So there's this natural set of incentives that drives a lot of choices and operating procedures on the ground that create more structure, more scale, more leverage, and drive more Hiring. Everyone wants to become a manager of people. They don't want to just be doing the same IC job forever, individual contributor job forever. So if they want to be a manager, they got to find more stuff to do. And then they got to hire people to do that stuff. So all of these organizations, whether again, and we've all been on boards of nonprofits, I'm sure. And we've all been involved in this sort of thing. There's always this, like, incentive to raise more capital, to hire more people, to do more stuff that sort of, it's really unclear until you really dig into the psychology of each individual Person working there why this is happening. I don't think that the federal government is any different. Each of these people feel they want to be more important. They want to have a bigger role. They want to have a bigger impact. Make more impact, yeah. Virtuous, right? Job directionally is to regulate, then what's the scalar on regulation? More regulation. So therefore, to do more, you have to regulate more. There's no regulator that says I want to regulate less over time because we've created a system that's one directional. So you have to have these resets. If you don't have them naturally, they're going to happen unnaturally in the form of social unrest and breakdowns of the economy and collapse of social structures, all these other Things that happen way, way down. On a kind of national scale because of the outsized role the federal government plays in our national economy here today. So you have to have these unnatural forces come in and do this readjustment from time to time. Otherwise, it's just going to</blockquote>

### [06:16] America's Untapped Potential


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (04:43 - 06:15)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa8a6dd3-4d74-4136-b86f-c117301884e5)


**America's Untapped Potential**

- America, like Microsoft under Ballmer, has immense potential but has been mismanaged.
- By simply stopping "really, really dumb things" like excessive regulations, America can unlock significant growth.
- This is analogous to Satya Nadella's turnaround of Microsoft, which involved ceasing counterproductive practices.
- A key area for improvement is reducing excessive regulations that hinder development.
-  This has led to too many administrators and unnecessary complexities, exemplified by the inefficient allocation of funds for rural broadband and EV chargers under the Harris administration.

<blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>So if they execute unstated plans and there are some of the world's greatest execution machines involved, Elon generally does what he says he's going to do. Like, this is going to be awesome for America, for markets, for the world. And the analogy I keep coming back to is Satya Nadella taking over as CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft was a monopoly, incredibly advantaged. It had just been horribly mismanaged for years. All he had to do to start winning was stop doing really, really dumb things. And that's an incredible place to be. You know, America, like we're the greatest country. You know, we've got, you know, oceans on two sides, peaceful neighbors, incredible natural resources, you know, completely, you know, can produce our own food and energy, like in Many ways, most privileged country on earth. But sometimes with great privilege comes great, like stupidity. And California, to me, would be a leading example of that. Most, in many ways, most privileged state in America, and has printed it away with bad policies. And I do think one thing that everyone of all political stripes agrees on is there are too many regulations that result in far too many administrators, far too much complexity, and an Inability to build things in America.

**Bitcoin vs. USD**

- David Friedberg agrees with Gavin Baker that Bitcoin is a potential threat to the US dollar.
- He points out the irony of Trump supporting Bitcoin while simultaneously opposing other alternative currencies.
- Friedberg believes that eventually, the US government will recognize Bitcoin as a threat.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Well, I definitely concur with Gavin. I think Bitcoin fundamentally is meant to be, supposed to be, ultimately will become a real threat to the US dollar. And it's kind of ironic that Trump had this declaration this week that he's going to put 100% tariff on all these BRICS nations that try to participate in an alternative currency to the US dollar, the greatest currency on earth, when he literally turns around and then says, we're going to support Bitcoin. It felt like the biggest irony of the week to me, because I do think Bitcoin is the big threat to the US dollar. And I do think that at some point, whether it's this administration or the next, they're going to wake up to that fact. And maybe the Bitcoin does, you know, the network state concept does emerge. And that's where we end up. But I do think we want to have and are going to have a strong federal government in the United States for quite some time, that's going to play an important role in everyone's lives here. And I don't know if you can really just say, let the dollar, you know, be supplanted by Bitcoin.

**Regulating Private Investments**

- If private companies were made available to ordinary investors like public companies, regulatory changes would be required.
- Private companies currently adhere to lower disclosure and reporting standards compared to their public counterparts.
- Public companies are subject to stricter standards for a reason, concerning financial transparency and data integrity.

**Restricting China's Access to Advanced Compute**

- The US is restricting China's access to advanced computing and networking technology, like a "sophons" from the sci-fi novel *The Three-Body Problem*.
- Despite this, China remains close behind the US in AI development.
- New chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom in the coming year might make it impossible for China to keep up.

**New Scaling Laws in AI**

- Grok 3's large GPU cluster will provide data on whether scaling laws are breaking down or holding as models grow.
- There's a new scaling axis called 'test time compute' or 'inference scaling'.
-  Giving models more time to think about complex questions dramatically improves performance, similar to how humans tackle problems.

<blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>The other question you raise, David, is very interesting. And by the way, we should note there is now a new axis of scaling. Some people call it test time compute. Some people call it inference scaling. And basically the way this works, you just think of these models as human. The more you speak to one of these models, the way you'd speak to your 17-year going off to take the SAT, the better it will do for you. As a human, if I ask you, David, what's two plus two, four flashes in your mind right away. If I ask you to, you know, unify a grand unified theory of physics that accounts for both quantum mechanics and relativistic physics, you will think for a lot longer. We have been, yeah, nobody knows. We have been giving these models the same amount of time to think no matter how complicated the question was. What we've now learned is if you let them think for longer about more complex questions, test time compute, you can dramatically improve their IQ. So we're just at the beginning of this new scaling law. But I think the question you raise on ROI is very good.</blockquote>

**Health Insurance Business**

- United Healthcare's medical loss ratio is ~85%, meaning they pay out 85 cents of every dollar collected in insurance premiums for claims.
- Health insurance, alongside auto insurance, is one of the most challenging businesses due to constant payouts and difficulty managing losses.
- There's a delicate balance between keeping health insurance affordable and managing the cost of medical claims. If all claims were paid, premiums would rise, making insurance unaffordable.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Yeah. United Healthcare's medical loss ratio is about 85%. So 85 cents of it. So 85 cents of every dollar they collect an insurance premium, they're paying out in claims. If you guys want to look at what the most egregious insurance industry in the world is, it's title insurance. And I'll give you the list of the rest. Travel insurance is pretty bad. They pay out like nothing. You were in the insurance business for a bit there. Yeah. Like, I mean, you know, health insurance is the hardest, one of the hardest besides auto insurance businesses to be in. You're paying out constantly. And there is a very difficult kind of process of managing losses, because the number of claims that comes in, it's very easy to suddenly pay everything out. And then your premium goes up, and then people can't afford the health insurance. So you're striking this balance of making health insurance affordable against the cost of medical claims.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. AI reflects the flaws of existing healthcare systems, with its effectiveness directly tied to the human-written rules it automates, highlighting the need for systemic improvements.
2. Denial rates in healthcare are influenced by the speed of AI executing flawed processes, rather than the technology itself, emphasizing the importance of redesigning business models.
3. To improve healthcare workflows for professionals, new tools must be integrated seamlessly into existing systems like electronic health records to enhance adoption and reduce burden.
4. Startups should focus on creating AI-driven products that resonate with healthcare providers, taking into account their insights and the industry's demands to encourage widespread use.
5. AI has considerable potential in enhancing clinical trials, where even small improvements can lead to significant financial benefits, drawing parallels to optimization successes in advertising.
6. There is a unique opportunity to design AI-native health plans that rethink payment mechanisms and risk underwriting, aiming for personalization rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

### ‚ú® Summary
In a value-based care world, AI serves as a catalyst for improvement, yet its effectiveness directly depends on the existing human-written rules it automates. Current complaints regarding increased denial rates stem from the speed of AI in executing flawed rules, not from the technology itself. The root issue lies within the human-designed processes, and a shift to new business models provides an opportunity to address and rectify these systemic flaws, promoting more logical spend control.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It's fun to think that in a fee-for world, AI is nice, but maybe actually goes against what you want. In a value-based care world, actually AI is the catalyst. If you can do things better, you can see the value.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's actually funny, the example that that reminds me of is how the AI are getting sued right now. There's a bunch of major national payers who are using AI algorithms to automate prior authorization. And so all they're doing is taking the rules that humans wrote, that humans were executing slowly, and doing it faster. And so now all of a sudden, everyone is complaining, oh, everything, like the denial rate is going up, but it's actually not the rate of denial is not going up, it's the speed with which The denials are happening that's going up. Don't blame the technology, the humans who actually wrote the rules and you're just seeing kind of an exacerbated version of it. We're going to deal with a lot of that of kind of the finger pointing at the technology where it's actually just implementing the broken system underneath it. And that's why this kind of move to like new business models gives you the opportunity to clean that up and start with logical ways to control spend.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To enhance the workflow for healthcare professionals, especially doctors, new tools must be designed to be perceived as beneficial rather than burdensome. This can be achieved by integrating solutions directly into existing systems like electronic health records (EHR), eliminating the need for individual physician buy-in. Startups should focus on creating products that are eagerly adopted by healthcare providers, tapping into their understanding of the industry and user needs. Additionally, there is significant potential for AI-driven innovations in clinical trials. By improving the efficiency of clinical trials, which are crucial in healthcare and highly funded, even a modest enhancement in their performance can yield substantial returns, making this sector ripe for development.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think so. The whole problem with co-pilots is, can you work it in a way that goes in the doctor workflow where they view it as a benefit, not a nuisance. It's not some alert or whatever. It's like something where they are going to it. If you can do that, and maybe we've seen this with scribes and so on, something where doctors are like, hell yeah, I want this. This is great. If we can create that, and maybe that's the challenge and the call to arms for founders, create something, some product that people are clamoring for it. And that's obviously knowing that space really well and knowing your customers and knowing your people are going to use it. I think if you can get into the workflow then I think it could go really well.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Let's just embed it into the EHR workflow so that inevitably it's just there when they open it up, and there's not really any need for individual physician buy-in.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, totally.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Given what we just talked about and all these grand challenges, what are some of the types of startups that we wish that would walk through the door that we just haven't seen yet?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
AI holds significant potential to enhance clinical trials, which are crucial to healthcare and involve substantial financial investments. A mere 5-10% improvement in clinical trials could lead to substantial monetary benefits, as seen in past experiences with optimization in other sectors, like advertising. Additionally, there's a unique opportunity to develop an AI-native health plan that fundamentally rethinks payment mechanisms, risk underwriting, and patient-provider networks. Such a plan could leverage data to achieve minor cost reductions that amount to millions, while also personalizing health plans according to individual behaviors and medical histories, contrasting sharply with the current one-size-fits-all approach. This convergence of AI and healthcare paves the way for transformative advancements that could significantly impact both clinical trials and health insurance models.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit. I remember a decade or so ago, I have a acquaintance who was working for Google and they were optimizing various filters and this and that. They made it 5x better, one of the ad filters. And basically 5x was $100 million. A 5% was $100 million. And so I may be really jealous. I'm working on something in drug design or whatever to make big leaps and bounds. And small things for big cash flows can have a huge impact. Something for clinical trials could be huge. Or even just picking the order of rank ordering of clinical trials to do a better job there. Anything in that space I think would have a huge impact and we haven't seen very much. And part of it is like it's maybe not where, if you're outside of that space, you may not think to go. I think that would be my pick. Yeah. I don't know what's your pick.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Mine would be, I mean, kind of comparable in the sense of the nature of the opportunity, which is, if you were to design an AI native health plan from scratch, and basically be the way by Which healthcare payments flow, like all the problems that we talked about earlier. What are the components of a health plan? It's a payments mechanism and claims. It is a underwriting chassis in terms of how you score risk within a population. And then it's a network of who are the providers that you would actually steer patients to on the basis of understanding what kinds of services they need. And the way that those are built today, you know, you see huge opportunities to both leverage data and AI in the sense of exactly what you just talked about, where a 1% impact on the cost Structure of a health plan, or the way that you underwrite risk in a certain health plan could literally mean hundreds of millions of dollars, of either cost savings or better economics To the providers who are part of those networks. So that to me, kind of this notion of a full stack AI native health plan that takes full risk on populations and exploits all of these data sets that we're talking about to really understand At almost at an individual level. You can almost sort of imagine like an individualized health plan that is purposeful for you on the basis of your behaviors and your medical history and things like that, that is priced Entirely different than all of your employee peers who are in the same group plan versus what it is today where it's so least common denominator and like sort of everyone loses because You're trying to design for everyone in the same sort of brute force fashion.</blockquote>

**Language Model Size and Performance**

- Larger networks capture simpler correlations and patterns first, like common words and basic sentence structure. 
- As networks grow, they progressively grasp more complex patterns, similar to how physical processes exhibit one-over-F noise.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>If I think about the patterns in language, there are some really simple patterns. Some words are much more common than others, like the, then there's basic noun verb structure. Then there's the fact that, you know, nouns and verbs have to agree. They have to coordinate. And there's the higher level sentence structure. Then there's the thematic structure of paragraphs. And so the fact that there's this regressing structure, you can imagine that as you make the networks larger, first they capture the really simple correlations, the really simple Patterns, and there's this long tail of other patterns. With the one over F noise in physical processes like resistors, then you can imagine as you make the network larger, it's kind of capturing more and more of that distribution. And so that smoothness gets reflected in how well the models are at predicting and how well they perform. Language is</blockquote>

**Anthropic's Race to the Top**

- Anthropic's co-founder, Chris Olah, pioneered mechanistic interpretability, focusing on understanding AI models internally. 
- Despite initially lacking commercial application, Anthropic invested in this research for safety and transparency, inspiring other companies to follow suit, thus raising the bar for responsible AI development.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>Early in the history of Anthropic, one of our co-founders, Chris Ola, who I believe you're interviewing soon, he's the co-founder of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which Is an attempt to understand what's going on inside AI models. So we had him and one of our early teams focus on this area of interpretability, which we think is good for making models safe and transparent. For three or four years, that had no commercial application whatsoever. It still doesn't today. We're doing some early betas with it, and probably it will eventually. But this is a very, very long research bet and one in which we've built in public and shared our results publicly. And we did this because we think it's a way to make models safer. An interesting thing is that as we've done this, other companies have started doing it as well, in some cases because they've been inspired by it. In some cases, because they're worried that, you know, if other companies are doing this that look more responsible, they want to look more responsible, too. No one wants to look like the irresponsible actor. And so they adopt this. They adopt this as well. When folks come to Anthropic, interpretability is often a draw. And I tell them the other places you didn't go, tell them why you came here. And then you see soon that there's interpretability teams elsewhere as well. And in a way that takes away our competitive advantage because it's like, oh, now others are doing it as well, but</blockquote>

### [44:21] Claude 3.5's Impact on Engineers

**Claude 3.5's Impact on Engineers**

- Even highly skilled engineers at Anthropic found previous code models unhelpful.
- Claude 3.5 changed this, with engineers reporting it saved them hours on tasks.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>As well, by the way. There were a couple of very strong engineers here at Anthropic who all previous code models, both produced by us and produced by all the other companies, hadn't really been useful to Them. They maybe this is useful to the beginner. It's not useful to me. But Sonnet 3.5, the original one, for the first time, they said, oh my God, this helped me with something that it would have taken me hours to do. This is the first model that actually saved me time. So again, the waterline is rising. And then I think the new Sonnet has been even better. In terms of what it takes, I mean, I'll just say it's been across the board. It's in the pre-training. It's in the post-training. It's in various evaluations that we do. We've observed this as well. And if we go into the details of the benchmark, so SWE Bench is basically, you know, since you're a programmer, you know, you'll be familiar with like pull requests and, you know, just Pull requests are like, you know, like a sort of atomic unit of work. You know, you could say, I'm, you know, I'm implementing one, I'm implementing one thing. And so SWE bench actually gives you kind of a real world situation where the code base is in the current state. And I'm trying to implement something that's, you know, that's described in language. We have internal benchmarks where we measure the same thing. And you say, just give the model free reign to like, you know, do anything, run anything, edit anything. How well is it able to complete these tasks? And it's that benchmark that's gone from it can do it 3% of the time to it can do it about 50% of the time. So I actually do believe that you can gain benchmarks, but I think if we get to 100% of that benchmark in a way that isn't kind of like overtrained or game for that particular benchmark, Probably represents a real and serious increase in kind of programming ability. And I would suspect that if we can get to 90%, 95%, that it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant fraction of software engineering tasks.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Lex Fridman</b><br/><br/>Well, ridiculous timeline question.</blockquote>

### [56:45] Difficulty of Controlling LLMs


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (55:11 - 56:55)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f5a7ff05-3e06-4b9a-ba2d-e4dfdc38c30d)


**Difficulty of Controlling LLMs**

- Controlling LLMs across the board is difficult, and seemingly simple changes (like reducing apologies) can have unintended consequences (like increased rudeness or overconfidence).
- Steering LLM behavior is challenging due to trade-offs and the whack-a-mole aspect where addressing one issue creates others.


#### üìö Transcript

<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>Others like kind of know it, but forget it. Like it is very difficult to control across the board how the models behave. You cannot just reach in there and say, oh, I want the model to like apologize less. Like you can do that. You can include trading data that says like, oh, the model should like apologize less. But then in some other situation, they end up being like super rude or like overconfident in a way that's like misleading people. So there are all these trade-offs. For example, another thing is if there was a period during which models, ours, and I think others as well, were too verbose, right? They would like repeat themselves. They would say too much. You can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the models for just talking for too long. What happens when you do that, if you do it in a crude way, is when the models are coding, sometimes they'll say rest of the code goes here, right? Because they've learned that that's a way to economize and that they see it. And then, and then, so that leads the model to be so-called lazy in coding where they, where they, where they're just like, ah, you can finish the rest of it. It's not, it's not because we want to, you know, save on compute or because, you know, the models are lazy and, you know, during winter break or any of the other kind of conspiracy theories That have, come up. It's actually, it's just very hard to control the behavior of the model, to steer the behavior of the model in all circumstances at once. You can kind of, there's this whack-a aspect where you push on one thing and like, you know, these other things start to move as well that you may not even notice or measure. And so one of the reasons that I care so much about, you know, kind of grand alignment of these AI systems in the future is actually these systems</blockquote>

### [01:05:57] AI Misuse Risks

**AI Misuse Risks**

- Humanity has been protected by the fact that highly intelligent people rarely want to do evil things. 
- AI could break this correlation by being a much more intelligent agent.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>If we had a lot more people like that, the world would be a much more dangerous place. And so my worry is that by being a much more intelligent agent, AI could break that correlation. And so I do have serious worries about that. I believe we can prevent those worries. But I think as a counterpoint to Machines of Loving Grace, I want to say that there's still serious risks. And the second range of risks would be the autonomy risks, which is the idea that models might on their own, particularly as we give them agency than they've had in the past, particularly As we give them supervision over wider tasks like, you know, writing whole code bases or someday even, you know, effectively operating entire companies. They're on a long enough leash. Are they doing what we really want them to do? It's very difficult to even understand in detail what they're doing, let alone control it. And like I said, these early signs that it's hard to perfectly draw the boundary between things the model should do and things the model shouldn't do, that if you go to one side, you get Things that are annoying and useless. And you go to the other side, you get other behaviors. If you fix one thing, it creates other problems. We're getting better and better at solving this. I don't think this is an unsolvable problem. I think this is a science, like the safety of airplanes or the safety of cars or the safety of drugs. I don't think there's any big thing we're missing. I just think we need to get better at controlling these models. And so these are the two risks I'm worried about. And our responsible scaling plan, which I'll recognize is a very long-winded answer to your question. I love it. I love it. Our responsible scaling plan is designed to address these two types of risks.</blockquote>

### [01:11:08] AI Safety Levels

**AI Safety Levels**

- Anthropic has defined AI Safety Levels (ASLs) to categorize AI systems based on their potential risks.
- Different safety and security measures are implemented depending on the ASL.


#### üìö Transcript
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>So ASL 3 is going to be the point at which the models are helpful enough to enhance the capabilities of non-state actors, right? State actors can already do a lot of, unfortunately, to a high level of proficiency, a lot of these very dangerous and destructive things. The difference is that non-state actors are not capable of it. And so when we get to ASL 3, we'll take special security precautions designed to be sufficient to prevent theft of the model by non-state actors and misuse of the model as it's deployed, Will have to have enhanced filters targeted at these particular areas. Cyber, bio, nuclear. Cyber, bio, nuclear, and model autonomy, which is less a misuse risk and more risk of the model doing bad things itself. ASL4 getting to the point where these models could enhance the capability of a already knowledgeable state actor and or become the main source of such a risk. Like if you wanted to engage in such a risk, the main way you would do it is through a model. And then I think ASL4 on the autonomy side, it's some amount of acceleration in AI research capabilities with an AI model. And then ASL five is where we would get to the models that are, you know, that are kind of, you know, truly capable, that it could exceed humanity in their ability to do any of these tasks. And so the point of the if-then structure commitment is basically to say, look, I don't know, I've been working with these models for many years and I've been worried about risk for many Years.</blockquote>

-  Iteratively verify and improve model properties through mechanistic interpretability.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>Think it's probably not the right approach. I think the right approach, instead of having something, you know, unaligned that, that like you're trying to prevent it from escaping. I think it's, it's to just design the model the right way or have a loop where you look inside the model and you're able to verify properties. And that gives you an opportunity to iterate and actually get it right. I think containing bad models is much worse solution than having good models.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Lex Fridman</b><br/><br/>Let me ask about regulation. What's the role</blockquote>

**Focus on your own vision**

- Focus on building your own vision rather than arguing with others.
- If your vision is compelling, people will follow, including competitors.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision. You might think they're not doing it the right way. You might think they're dishonest. Who knows? Maybe you're right. Maybe you're not. But what you should do is you should take some people you trust and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen. And if your vision is compelling, if you can make it appeal to people, some combination of ethically in the market, if you can make a company that's a place people want to join, that engages In practices that people think are reasonable while managing to maintain its position in the ecosystem at the same time, if you do that, people will copy it. And the fact that you are doing it, especially the fact that you're doing it better than they are, causes them to change their behavior in a much more compelling way than if they're your Boss and you're arguing with them. I just, I don't know how to be any more specific about it than that, but I think it's generally very unproductive to try and get someone else's vision to look like your vision. It's much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say, this is our vision. This is how we're going to do things. Your choice is you can ignore us, you can reject what we're doing, or you can start to become more like us. And imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And that plays out in the behavior of customers, that pays out in the behavior of the public, that plays out in the behavior of where people choose to work. And again, at the end, it's not about one company winning or another company winning. If we</blockquote>

**AI Research Advice**

- Start by experimenting with AI models to gain practical experience.
- Explore less crowded research areas like mechanistic interpretability, long-horizon learning, evaluations of dynamic systems, and multi-agent systems.


#### üìö Transcript

<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>Can I make an impact on the world? I think my number one piece of advice is to just start playing with the models. This was actually, I worry a little, this seems like obvious advice now. I think three years ago, it wasn't obvious and people started by, oh, let me read the latest reinforcement learning paper. Let me, you know, let me, let me kind of, no, I mean, that was really the, that was really the, the, and I mean, you should do that as well. But now, you know, with wider availability of models and APIs, people are doing this more, but I think, I think just experiential knowledge. These models are new artifacts that no one really understands. And so getting experience playing with them. I would also say, again, in line with the like, do something new, think in some new direction. Like, there are all these things that haven't been explored. Like, for example, mechanistic interpretability is still very new. It's probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model architectures because it's more popular than it was before. There are probably like 100 people working on it, but there aren't like 10,000 people working on it. And it's just this fertile area for study. There's so much low-hanging fruit. You can just walk by and, you know, you can just walk by and you can pick things. Um, and, and the, the only reason for whatever reason people aren't, people aren't interested in it enough. I think there are some things around long, long horizon learning and long horizon tasks where there's a lot to be done. I think evaluations are still, we're still very early in our ability to study evaluations, particularly for dynamic systems acting in the world. I think there's some stuff around multi-agent, um, skate where the puck is going is my, is my advice. And you don't have to be brilliant to think of it. Like all the things that are going to be exciting in five years, like in people even mentioned them as like, you know, conventional wisdom, but like, it's there's this barrier that people Don't double down as much as they could, or they're afraid to do something that's not the popular thing. I don't know why it happens, but getting over that barrier, that's my number one piece of advice.</blockquote>

- It's crucial to understand and communicate the positive impacts of AI to inspire and motivate people.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>And so I think it's actually very important to understand, what if things do go well? And the whole reason we're trying to prevent these risks is not because we're afraid of technology, not because we want to slow it down. It's because if we can get to the other side of these risks, right, if we can run the gauntlet successfully, to put it in stark terms, then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these Great things. And these things are worth fighting for. And these things can really inspire people. And I think I imagine because, look, you have all these investors, all these VCs, all these AI companies talking about all the positive benefits of AI. But as you point out, it's weird. There's actually a dearth of really getting specific about it. There's a lot of random people on Twitter, like posting these kind of like gleaming cities and this just kind of like vibe of like, grind, accelerate harder, like kick out the decel. You know, it's just this very like aggressive ideological, but then you're like, well, what are you, what are you actually excited about? And so I figured that, you know, I think it would be interesting and valuable for someone who's actually coming from the risk side to try and really make a try at explaining, explaining, Explain what the benefits are. Because I think it's something we can all get behind. And I want people to understand, I want them to really understand that this isn't doomers versus accelerationists.</blockquote>

**Slow Productivity Increases**

- Despite technological advancements, productivity increases from computer and internet revolutions have been underwhelming.
- Factors like firm structure and slow rollout to poorer regions contribute to this.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>So that's on one side. On the other side, there's another set of perspectives, which I have actually in some ways more sympathy for, which is, look, we've seen big productivity increases before, right? Economists are familiar with studying the productivity increases that came from the computer revolution and internet revolution. And generally, those productivity increases were underwhelming. They were less than you might imagine. There was a quote from Robert Solo, you see the computer revolution everywhere except the productivity statistics. So why is this the case? People point to the structure of firms, the structure of enterprises, how slow it's been to roll out our existing technology to very poor parts of the world, which I talk about in the Essay, right? How do we get these technologies to the poorest parts of the world that are behind on cell phone technology, computers, medicine, let alone, you know, newfangled AI that hasn't been Invented yet. So you could have a perspective that's like, well, this is amazing technically, but it's all a nothing burger. You know, I think Tyler Cowen, who wrote something in response to my essay, has that perspective. I think he thinks the radical change will happen eventually, but he thinks it'll take 50 or 100 years. And you could have even more static perspectives on the whole thing.

- He acknowledges potential delays but believes blockers are diminishing, increasing the likelihood of near-term AGI.

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>The table. So this is, of course, the thing I've been grappling with for many years, and I'm not at all confident. Every time, if I say 2026 or 2027, there will be like a zillion people on Twitter who will be like, AICO said 2026, 2027, and it'll be repeated for like the next two years. This is definitely when I think it's going to happen. So whoever's excerpting these clips will crop out the thing I just said and only say the thing I'm about to say, but I'll just say it anyway. So if you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right? If you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level. And last year we were at undergraduate level. And the year before we were at like the level of a high school student. Again, you can you can quibble with what tasks and for what we're still missing modalities. But those are being added like computer use was added, like image in was added, like image generation has been added. If you just kind of like, and this is totally unscientific, but if you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll Get there by 2026 or 2027. Again, lots of things could derail it. We could run out of data. You know, we might not be able to scale clusters as much as we want. Like, you know, maybe Taiwan gets blown up or something and, you know, then we can't produce as many GPUs as we want. So there are all kinds of things that could derail the whole process. So I don't fully believe the straight line extrapolation, but if you believe the straight line extrapolation, you'll, you'll, we'll get there in 2026 or 2027. I think the most likely is that there's some mild delay relative to that. I don't know what that delay is, but I think it could happen on schedule. I think there could be a mild delay. I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in 100 years. The number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing. We are rapidly running out of truly convincing brocklers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years. There were a lot more in 2020. Although my guess, my hunch at that time was that we'll make it through all those blockers. So sitting as someone who has seen most of the blockers cleared out of the way, I kind of suspect my hunch, my suspicion is that the rest of them will not block us. But look at the end of the the day, like, I don't want to represent this as a scientific prediction. People call them scaling laws.</blockquote>

**AI in Biological Research**

- AI systems will initially assist biological researchers, acting like highly capable grad students.
- Eventually, they will lead research, potentially inventing revolutionary technologies like CRISPR.

And so it'll look like there's a human professor and a thousand AI grad students. And if you go to one of these Nobel Prize winning biologists or so, you'll say, okay, well, you had like 50 grad students. Well, now you have a thousand and they're smarter than you are, by the way. Then I think at some point it'll flip around where the AI systems will be the PIs, will be the leaders and, and, and, you know, they'll be, they'll be ordering humans or other AI systems Around. So I think that's how it'll work on the research side. And they would be the inventors of a CRISPR type technology. They would be the inventors of, of a CRISPR type technology. Um, and then I think, you know, as I say in the essay, we'll want to turn, turn, probably turning loose is the wrong, but we'll want to harness the AI systems to improve the clinical trial System as well. There's some amount of this that's regulatory, that's a matter of societal decisions, and that'll be harder. But can we get better at predicting the results of clinical trials? Can we get better at statistical design so that what, you know, clinical trials that used to require, you know, 5,000 people and therefore, you know, needed $100 million in a year to Enroll them, now they need 500 people in two months to enroll them.

### [02:38:20] AI Disrupting Programming

**AI Disrupting Programming**

- Programming will be disrupted quickly by AI because it's a skill close to AI development. 
- The fast feedback loop in programming, where AI can write, run, and interpret code, accelerates this disruption.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>I think that's going to be one of the areas that changes fastest for two reasons. One, programming is a skill that's very close to the actual building of the AI. So the farther a skill is from the people who are building the AI, the longer it's going to take to get disrupted by the AI, right? Like I truly believe that like AI will disrupt agriculture. Maybe it already has in some ways, but that's just very distant from the folks who are building AI. And so I think it's going to take longer. But programming is the bread and butter of a large fraction of the employees who work at Anthropic and at the other companies. And so it's going to happen fast. The other reason it's going to happen fast is with programming, you close the loop. Both when you're training the model and when you're applying the model, the idea that the model can write the code means that the model can then run the code and then see the results and Interpret it back. And so it really has an ability, unlike hardware, unlike biology, which we just discussed, the model has an ability to close the loop. And so I think those two things are going to lead to the model getting good at programming very fast. As I saw</blockquote>

### [02:40:47] Comparative Advantage in Coding

**Comparative Advantage in Coding**

- Even when AIs can automate 80% of coding tasks, the remaining 20% done by humans (e.g., high-level design) will become more critical.
- This dynamic will persist until AIs can fully replace all aspects of the job, which will eventually challenge the notion of comparative advantage.


#### üìö Transcript
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Dario Amodei</b><br/><br/>Now that said, I think comparative advantage is powerful. We'll find that when AIs can do 80% of a coder's job, including most of it that's literally like write code with a given spec, we'll find that the remaining parts of the job become more Leveraged for humans. Right. Humans will there'll be more about like high level system design or, you know, looking at the app and like, is it architected well? And the design and UX aspects and eventually AI will be able to do those as well. That's my vision of the powerful AI system. But I think for much longer than we might expect, we will see that small parts of the job that humans still do will expand to fill their entire job in order for the overall productivity To go up. That's something we've seen. It used to be that writing and editing letters was very difficult, and writing the print was difficult. Well, as soon as you had word processors and then computers, and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it, then that became instant and all the focus was on the ideas. So this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny parts of the tasks to large parts of the tasks and creates new tasks in order to expand productivity, I think that's going to Be the case. Again, someday AI will be better at everything and that logic won't apply. And then we all have humanity will have to think about how to collectively deal with</blockquote>

**System Prompt Iteration**

-  To address asymmetry in Claude's responses to political views, Anthropic nudged the model to engage with tasks even if its own opinion differed.
-  They also addressed Claude's tendency to overemphasize objectivity by preventing it from explicitly claiming to be objective.

<blockquote><b>Amanda Askell</b><br/><br/>I think there's sometimes an asymmetry. I think I noted this in, I can't remember if it was that part of the system prompt or another, but the model was slightly more inclined to like refuse tasks if it was like about either say So maybe it would refuse things with respect to like a right-wing politician but with an equivalent left-wing politician like wouldn't and we wanted more symmetry there um and and Would maybe perceive certain things to be like i think it was the thing of like if a lot of people have like a certain like political view um and want to like explore it you don't want Claude To be like well my opinion is different and so I'm going to treat that as like harmful um and so I think it was partly to like nudge the model to just be like hey if a lot of people like believe This thing you should just be like engaging with the task and like willing to do it. Each of those parts of that is actually doing a different thing, because it's funny when you write out the like without claiming to be objective, because like what you want to do is push The model. So it's more open. It's a little bit more neutral. But then what it would love to do is be like, as objective like it would just talk about how objective it was and i was like claude you're still like biased and have issues and so stop like Claiming that everything i'm like the solution to like potential bias from you is not to just say that what you think is objective so that was like with initial versions of that that part Of the system prompt when i was like iterating on it it was like a lot of parts of these sentences...</blockquote>

### [03:56:10] Optimal Failure Rate


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (03:55:43 - 03:58:58)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/594447f2-54cf-4d77-8e5b-6395630652f7)


**Optimal Failure Rate**

- Consider your optimal failure rate.
- If you don't fail occasionally, you might not be trying hard enough or taking enough risks.
- However, the acceptable rate of failure depends on the cost and consequences.
- If failure is costly, play it safe; if it's relatively low cost, tolerate more failure to push your boundaries.
- Ask yourself, "Am I under-failing?" to ensure you're taking enough risks in areas where failure is less detrimental.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Amanda Askell</b><br/><br/>And in fact, if you don't see enough failure, sometimes that's more concerning. And so like in life, you know, I'm like, if I don't fail occasionally, I'm like, am I trying hard enough? Like, like, surely there's harder things that I could try or bigger things that I could take on if I'm literally never failing. And so in and of itself, I think like not failing is often actually kind of a failure. Now, this varies because I'm like, well, you know, if this is easy to say when, especially as failure is like less costly, you know, so at the same time, I'm not going to go to someone who Is like, I don't know, like living month to month and then be like, why don't you just try to do a startup? Like, I'm just not I'm not going to say that to that person because I'm like, well, that's a huge risk. You might like you maybe have a family depending on you. You might lose your house. Like then I'm like, actually, your optimal rate of failure is quite low and you should probably play it safe. Because like right now, you're just not in a circumstance where you can afford to just like fail and it not be costly. And yeah, in cases with AI, I guess, I think similarly, where I'm like, if the failures are small, and the costs are kind of like low, then I'm like, then, you know, you're just going to See that, like, when you do the system prompt, you can't iterate on it forever. But the failures are probably, hopefully going to be kind of small, and you can like fix them. Really big failures, like things that you can't recover from, I'm like, those are the things that actually I think we tend to underestimate the badness of um I've thought about this Strangely in my own life where I'm like I just think I don't think enough about things like car accidents or like or like I've thought this before but like how much I depend on my hands for My work then I'm like things that just injure my hands I'm like you, you know, I don't know. It's like, there's, these are like, there's lots of areas where I'm like, the cost of failure there is really high. And in that case, it should be like close to zero. Like I probably just wouldn't do a sport if they were like, by the way, lots of people just like break their fingers a whole bunch doing this. I'd be like, that's not for me.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Lex Fridman</b><br/><br/>Yeah. I actually had a flood of that thought. I recently broke my pinky doing a sport. And I remember just looking at it thinking you're such an idiot. Why do you do sport? Because you realize immediately the cost of it on life. Yeah, but it's nice in terms of optimal rate of failure to consider like the next year, how many times in a particular domain, life, whatever, career, am I okay with it? How many times am I okay to fail? Because I think it always, you don't want to fail on the next thing, but if you allow yourself the, like if you look at it as a sequence of trials yeah then then failure just becomes much</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Amanda Askell</b><br/><br/>More okay but it sucks it sucks to fail well i don't know sometimes i think it's like am i under failing is like a question i'll also ask myself so maybe that's the thing that i think people Don't like ask enough uh because if the optimal rate of failure is often greater than zero then sometimes it does feel you should look at part of parts of your life and be like are there Places here where I'm just under failing?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Lex Fridman</b><br/><br/>That's a profound and a hilarious question, right? Everything seems to be going really great. Am I not failing enough?</blockquote>

- AI consciousness presents unique challenges due to structural differences from biological brains and lack of evolutionary context. 
- While AI may exhibit intelligence associated with consciousness, its different problems and analogies make easy comparisons difficult.

And then I realized I was like, I think that having looked into this, I think that the chance that plants are conscious is probably higher than like most people do. I still think it's really small. I was like, oh, they have this like negative, positive feedback response, these responses to their environment, something that looks, it's not a nervous system but it has this kind Of like functional like equivalence um so this is like a long-winded way of being like these basically ai is this it has an entirely different set of problems with consciousness because It's structurally different it didn't evolve it might not have it you know it might not have the equivalent of basically a nervous system at least that seems possibly important for Like um sentience if not for uh consciousness at the same time it has all of the like language and intelligence components that we normally associate probably with consciousness perhaps Like erroneously um so it's strange because it's a little bit like the animal consciousness case but the set of problems and the set of analogies are just very different. So it's not like a clean answer. I'm just sort of like, I don't think we should be completely dismissive of the idea. And at the same time, it's an extremely hard thing to navigate because of all of these like disanalogies to the human brain and to like brains in general and</blockquote>

**Software Market Shrinkage Due to AI**

- The global software market, including licenses, consulting, and internal IT, is approximately $5 trillion annually, growing at 13%.
- Jason Calacanis predicts AI could shrink this market to $500 billion due to decreased human involvement in software development, making code creation cheaper.
- This would lead to a more competitive landscape where companies fight over a smaller market.

And that's compounding 13% a year. I'm pretty sure that the market here shrinks by an order of magnitude. And instead of fighting over $5 trillion, I think we'll be fighting over $500 billion.</blockquote>

**AI Agents Expanding TAM**

- Legacy software systems may shrink as AI-powered solutions emerge.
- There's a simultaneous expansion of the TAM through AI agents targeting specific jobs or roles.
- Startups are building AI agents to replicate tasks traditionally done by accountants, podcast producers, virtual assistants, and other professionals.
- This represents a new category of software distinct from existing legacy systems.
- Two things at once occurring, deflation in legacy systems and expansion of TAM.

And I'm seeing this on the front lines. We run a program found university. I've talked about it here before where we see people pitching us. They're year zero startups, two or three person teams. And what they're doing is they're not going after existing legacy software. They're kind of going after jobs. Looking at a position or a job somewhere. This is an accountant. We're going to take an accountant. We're going to make the number one accountant in the world that's an AI agent, an agent. We're going to make a podcast producer, a podcast AI. We're going to make a virtual assistant with Athena. We're just seeing it over and over again. That's a whole nother category where you study a person's behavior as they work, a social media manager and what they do, and then you replicate it with AI. And that's something that just hasn't previously been done. So there could be two things occurring here, Chamath and Aaron, at the same time, which is a deflation in legacy systems and they'll be replaced. And then additionally, human capital and jobs that are easy enough for AI to do as an agent will also expand the TAM two things at the same time.</blockquote>

**Thoughtful Trade-offs with Technology**

- Consider the trade-offs when adopting new technologies.
- Handwriting is one example: while typing is faster, handwriting engages different cognitive processes and may improve memory encoding.

<blockquote><b>Christine Rosen</b><br/><br/>And I think that that's absolutely right. And it would probably be less of a concern if we spent more of our day every day doing other things with our hands besides typing or besides swiping on a screen. And I think the opportunity cost here is another concern because I agree with you. I mean, I do, I write, I'm a list maker, so I do write my lists by hand. And, you know, I do have some friends with whom I exchange handwritten letters, not very many, and very rarely tend to send email or text messages. But there is something about the disappearance of these experiences, not just when it comes to writing, but to any way we use our physical bodies to interact with the world. Now, this is especially true, obviously, of the knowledge class folks, less so if you have a job where you work with your hands or you're an artist or musician and you spend your time and Really spend most of your day in a form of embodied cognition because you're using your mind and your body. But most people, a lot of people, mediate even their daily work now at a level that I think they end up lacking those experiences. And so taking away handwriting on top of that, and particularly for children whose childhoods are now absolutely saturated with technology, it's just one example among many where I think we haven't made a thoughtful trade-off and really discussed and thought through the choices we've made. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Well, so that phrase or that term trade-off is, I think, important here because there are trade-offs with any technology. And the one that comes to mind was the</blockquote>

**Shared Reality Erosion**

- We consume more information about others' experiences than we have unmediated experiences of our own.
- This leads to a lack of shared reality, which is toxic, especially in politics.

<blockquote><b>Christine Rosen</b><br/><br/>And what that means is that we, even though we're doing that, we somehow lack a shared reality. And I think this is where in politics in particular, it has become toxic, not because the internet lets people scream and yell at each other and social media rewards that kind of anger And hostility and anxiety, although it does because that brings greater engagement than happiness, looking at unicorns and puppies and kittens. But it's that we can't even agree on what reality looks like because we're so, the power we have now to carefully curate our reality and to not listen to what someone</blockquote>

**Revive Local News**

- Invest in reviving local news to address grift and corruption, which primarily occurs at the local level.
- This cultivates a new generation of journalists from diverse backgrounds, improving reporting and addressing trust deficits.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Christine Rosen</b><br/><br/>I would say two things about that. The first is that if you really want to invest, if look, if you're a billionaire and you want to throw your money at a good cause, one of the best things you could do is to try to revive local News. Because most of the grift and corruption and really awful things that impact people in the day-to happens at the local level. And we do not have those newspapers anymore. We don't have the person covering the city council meeting, going to the school board meetings. Only when some huge scandal erupts that becomes nationalized do people go to school board meetings and cover them anymore. And what that means is that that's where the trust deficit begins for people. Because if your city is supposed to come fix a pothole on your road and you've complained about it and you think that someone's getting a kickback from a contractor and that's why they're Not fixing the pothole, how do you prove that if you're just the average citizen? That's the role of journalism. And that would do another thing that I think is important. And that's cultivating new generation of journalists who don't come out of only the elite institutions. Because journalism, national journalism now, is drawing from a very small pool of talent. And it's, you know, Ivy and Ivy League plus universities. There's a lot of insularity to their worldview there, a lot of expectation of what the right people think. And that's always been the case at places like the New York Times and elsewhere. But I think that's spread. And you do not have a contrast with like the guy who went to the state university and got his first job covering, you know, city council meetings at a Midwest newspaper and then worked His way up and then became a political reporter in his 40s at The New York Times. That used to be the trajectory. That's not how it works anymore. And I think we lose both the skill and training and discipline of requiring people to cover those local issues and report on them honestly and cultivate sources, learn what it means To be a journalist. And we also lose a diversity of worldviews and experiences and class-based differences that are extremely obvious now when you look at places like the New York Times, places like the Washington Post. When they talk about people who aren't from their class, it's glaringly obvious because they don't know anybody who didn't come through those institutions and shares their views. So they seem very out of touch because they are. So I do think that those two things over the course of a generation or two could give us a revival of the kind of journalism and reporting that this country really needs.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>What can we do about</blockquote>

### [11:27] Massive Untapped Labor Markets Ripe for AI Disruption

**Massive Untapped Labor Markets Ripe for AI Disruption**

- The U.S. nurse labor market is worth over \$600 billion annually, yet the dedicated software market for nurses is almost nonexistent.
- This illustrates a massive opportunity for AI-powered software to automate tasks and augment human capabilities in labor-intensive industries.
- AI can address unmet needs, like language barriers in healthcare or chronic late payments in finance, where traditional software solutions have fallen short.
-  The potential for AI to disrupt these large labor markets is immense, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation.

<blockquote><b>Alex Rampell</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it's completely different because it's really comparing wages to software. And to take an example from a completely different field that also has no software market, there are about 4.7 million registered nurses in the U.S. Average wage for a nurse is a little over $120,000 a year. So it's a high-paying profession. And that means that the annual nurse, not software market, but wage market, is over $600 billion a year, which is a lot. And the worldwide software market is under $600 billion. Not just America. By the way, that nurse figure is just for the U.S. Of course, there are nurses in the U.K. France and Angola, like every country on Earth, right? Probably Antarctica has nurses, I'm sure. Almost certainly. They're probably even higher paid down there. So the labor market is enormous, but what is the dedicated software market for nurses? Like probably zero because nobody took the time to develop software. And you could try developing software, but it's just, there was no budget.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Haber</b><br/><br/>Economics didn't make sense.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Alex Rampell</b><br/><br/>Exactly. But if every hospital in the U.S. Currently has a nursing shortage, or maybe you're in Minneapolis where there's a giant Somalian expat community and you need nurses that speak that language, how do you find them? And it takes three to four years to actually get trained as a nurse. Now you have a software product that can deliver not everything that a nurse does. Of course, it can't be a phlebotomist, it can't perform CPR, but it can call you the night before your colonoscopy and say, don't eat food. And it can say that in 45 languages and it can actually have a conversation with you. So that's</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Alex Rampell</b><br/><br/>And versus charging for the filing cabinet, now they can say, well, we know that you wanted to hire five collections people. We know that you pay those collections people $80,000 a year with benefits and everything else. We know that it takes a year to train them. Now our software product can do that not for $80,000 a year, but for $2,000 a year. And that's incredible. So the question is actually, how will the customer think about this? Because once they start paying NetSuite 10 times more than they paid NetSuite last year, they're like, wow, my software budget has ballooned. I got to cut my software spend. Or will they say, wow, I'm saving so much money because as opposed to these five job openings, I'm waiting to pay $400,000 a year for these five collections people. Now I can pay $10,000 a year to NetSuite and I'm paying more for software, but less for labor. And that part, it's very, very new. But a lot of the hyper growth that we're seeing in this category of company is because they are really moving into the labor market and less the software market. And that nurse example is a prime example of that.</blockquote>

### [21:09] Copilot vs. Autopilot AI and the Impact on SaaS Revenue

**Copilot vs. Autopilot AI and the Impact on SaaS Revenue**

- Copilot AI enhances productivity by assisting users, potentially reducing the need for numerous support reps. 
- Autopilot AI automates tasks entirely, posing a greater threat to SaaS companies reliant on seat licenses. 
-  The transition isn't binary, but presents both a challenge and opportunity. Existing SaaS companies could see revenue decrease if they don't adapt, but they could also potentially 10x revenue by successfully implementing these AI tools.  Existing systems of record have an advantage because of the data they possess.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Alex Rampell</b><br/><br/>So it makes Angela so much more productive in her job. And that's great. Autopilot is like, Angela quit yesterday and we need somebody else to go answer emails because it's Black Friday. What do we do? What do we do? Okay, now we just throw the tool at the customer directly and have them answer the questions. And that's the big danger. Copilot is actually a danger for revenue as well, because why do I have 1,000 support reps? Because they can only answer 10 questions a day. And I get 10,000 queries a day, so it's just basic math. Now with Copilot, each one of my reps can answer 100 questions a day. I only need 100 reps. So now Zendesk lost 90% of its revenue. And then by the way, if autopilot becomes a thing and actually works very, very well, then I need nobody. And therefore I sell no seats if I'm Zendesk. So it's both defense and offense for these companies to figure out what the hell to do. Because if they play offense, they could maybe 10x the revenue because of the example, like it's $50 million for people or 1.4 million for, I'd rather get 50 million from Zendesk than 1.4 million. But they're probably not going to be able to take all 50 million, right? Because ultimately, like the cost of delivering these services is very low. The moat is not that high. It's higher for companies that have the system of record, I would argue, because all of your past correspondence with all of your customers is in a Zendesk. Or if I'm Salesforce, like every single communication that I've ever had with any of my customers, my pipeline, everything, it's in Salesforce. It's hard to yank that stuff out because everybody's using it. And it's not like this binary thing where tomorrow we're all autopilot. We're going to see a lot of these copilot tools. They will run on the systems of record. But even as they're running on the systems of record, now I need less seats.</blockquote>

### [24:48] Tenor's AI-Powered Patient Referral System

**Tenor's AI-Powered Patient Referral System**

- Tenor is using AI to automate patient referrals in healthcare, addressing the "messy inbox problem."
- Traditionally, medical records were faxed, requiring manual data entry into EMR systems. 
- Tenor trained a model on millions of healthcare documents to extract patient information programmatically.
- This reduces admin costs by ~90% and streamlines patient intake.
- Tenor initially wedged in by solving this specific problem and is now expanding to other areas like scheduling and benefits.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>We have a company, as an example, called Tenor that is doing this in a healthcare context. So the problem that they're solving specifically is around patient referrals. So you go to your general practitioner, they're referring you to a specialist, could be a dermatologist or an imaging center. Today, they're often faxing your medical records, and it is somebody's job to go physically to the fax machine, reenter that information into the EMR system. Tenor has trained a model against, I think, 4 million healthcare-specific documents, and now can basically extract all that information about the patient programmatically and Effectively begin to solve this patient intake problem. And they're able to reduce now about 90% of the admin costs of that patient intake before the patient is actually seeing the clinician. So they, again, wedged in with the messy in-box problem. And over time, they're now eating away at things like scheduling and eligibility and benefits. And over time, we'll see if they become the kind of core AI native system record.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Haber</b><br/><br/>And something you're pointing to there is also the</blockquote>

### [26:14] AI Differentiation vs. Defensibility

**AI Differentiation vs. Defensibility**

- AI is a powerful catalyst for differentiation, making software solutions significantly better than manual processes.
- However, the initial AI advantage (e.g., a unique model) is often short-lived and can be commoditized.
- True defensibility in AI-driven software comes from owning downstream workflows, deep system integration, and establishing traditional software moats like network effects or platform status.


#### üìö Transcript

<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Sort of this distinction between differentiation and defensibility. I think AI is an incredible catalyst for differentiation, right? Solving the messy inbox problem with software is a thousand times better than the human doing. It's not even on the same kind of playing field. Super differentiated way to wedge in, again, kind of own the downstream workflow. Is that wedge product alone defensible? I would argue no, right? Today, it feels like magic to the providers that they're working with. But I think that capability is going to become commoditized over time. They may have an advantage because they've trained a model for now, but I think that is ephemeral. I think the defensibility comes from, again, owning all of the downstream workflows, deeply integrating themselves into every other system that they have, effectively owning that Sort of core kind of end-to workflow. And I guess the hot take would be that moats still matter. And a lot of the moats in software today are the same that they've always been. So becoming a system of record, having a network effect, becoming a platform, having virality baked into your product, deeply embedding yourself into the existing system so it's Hard to rip out. Like these were all the heuristics that we would always have looked for in software, and they're still true today.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Alex Rampell</b><br/><br/>I agree with all</blockquote>

**AI Startups and Monetization**

- Most AI startups monetize via subscriptions, making their revenue streams clearer.
- This differs from the earlier internet era where the focus was on growth first and monetization later.
- Traditional business metrics like customer acquisition, retention, and gross profit still apply in evaluating AI businesses.
- One key difference is the increased potential market size for AI applications in various vertical SaaS markets.
- This shift is partly driven by AI's ability to automate tasks and create new possibilities within established industries.

And we're not seeing as many of those, but I don't think any of the fundamental isms of evaluating a business have really changed. The only thing that's more dangerous is since AI can now write software, it's just so much easier to spin these things up. Whereas to build something and scale it out, the reason why Friendster failed, like Friendster should have been the social networking winner, but their servers couldn't stay up. And MySpace should have been the winner, but they couldn't hire good engineers. There are all these different reasons that are not relevant today because the technology stack is so different. But again, it's present value, future profits. That's unchanged.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Angela Strange</b><br/><br/>I think one thing, and this is not a business metric, but that's changed is just potential market size.</blockquote>

What's really interesting is just actually a dearth of skills, of people who know how to deal with hardware and software together. You have a lot of people that went and got computer science degrees over the last decade, and relatively speaking, a lot fewer that went and got electrical engineering or mechanical Engineering degrees.

> It was possible to see Donald Trump‚Äôs first election victory as some kind of fluke. But after the results of this election, it‚Äôs clear that America is living in the Trump era. And for Americans who‚Äôve struggled to process this fact, you have lots of company around the world. From Hungary to Brazil, right-wing figures with openly authoritarian goals have been voted into power, to the concern of many of the people who live there.<br/>>  A political phenomenon that spans countries like this ‚Äî especially countries with such different levels of wealth, political systems and cultures ‚Äî requires an explanation that spans countries, too.¬†<br/>>  So we wanted to re-air this episode that originally published in November 2022, because it offers exactly that kind of theory. Pippa Norris is a political scientist at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government. She‚Äôs written dozens of books on topics ranging from comparative political institutions to right-wing parties and the decline of religion. In 2019, she and Ronald Inglehart published ‚Äú Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit and Authoritarian Populism ,‚Äù which gives the best explanation of the far right‚Äôs rise that I‚Äôve read. And it feels so much more relevant now in this country, after Trump‚Äôs decisive election.¬†<br/>>  In this conversation, we discuss what Norris calls the ‚Äúsilent revolution in cultural values‚Äù that has occurred across advanced democracies in recent decades, why the ‚Äútransgressive aesthetic‚Äù of leaders like Trump and Brazil‚Äôs Jair Bolsonaro is so central to their appeal, the role that economic anxiety and insecurity play in fueling right-wing backlashes and more.<br/>>  Mentioned:<br/>>   Sacred and Secular  by Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart<br/>>  ‚Äú Exploring drivers of vote choice and policy positions among the American electorate ‚Äù<br/>>  Book Recommendations:<br/>>   Popular Dictatorships  by Aleksandar Matovski<br/>>   Spin Dictators  by Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman<br/>>   The Origins of Totalitarianism  by Hannah Arendt<br/>>  Thoughts?

### [07:53] Post-Materialism & New Social Movements

**Post-Materialism & New Social Movements**

- Ronald Inglehart observed a shift in values among younger generations in the 60s & 70s.
- This generation, having grown up with more economic prosperity, prioritized 'post-material' issues.
- These included environmentalism, anti-nuclear protests, women's equality, and LGBTQ rights, leading to new social movements.
- These post-material values emphasized freedom, autonomy, diverse lifestyles, secularism, and cosmopolitanism over traditional values like fixed gender roles, religion, and nationalism.

<blockquote><b>Pippa Norris</b><br/><br/>They could take for granted that there was a certain level of economic prosperity. Remember, there was technology that was taking off in that era. There were blue collar workers who were increasing their wage packets. People could afford the nice things in life and they could go to college, which was a major revolution throughout Europe. As a result, they started to prioritize other things. And this is exemplified by the new social movements, think in the 60s and 70s. And so it wasn't just sex that was being invented, according to many observers, but many other things. The environmental movement, for example, and protests about climate change. There were changes in terms of protests about nuclear weapons and the old idea of military strength and defence. And there was movements in particular for women in order to get women's equality, the second wave women's movement, and of course, the rise of the LGBTQ movement as well. And all of these, Ron basically said, were part of a single pattern and they led to new parties. And in particular, what he predicted in that period was that this generation that was concerned with what he termed post-material issues, the quality of life, the ways in which we can Improve our living standards, took for granted material affluence. And so they moved on to other issues and other values, which they regarded as much more important, in particular freedom and autonomy, the ability to live your own life and to enjoy diverse Lifestyles, to enjoy gender fluidity, for example, not simply fix gender roles or fix sex roles in the family. It became much more of a secular focus rather than religion, much more of</blockquote>

### [27:52] Disorientation and Nostalgia in Politics

**Disorientation and Nostalgia in Politics**

- The feeling of disorientation, driven by rapid societal changes, fuels a specific political tendency.
- This disorientation stems from shifts in various domains, from immigration and social issues to economic policies, creating a sense of unease and unfamiliarity.
- The generation gap plays a significant role, as older individuals often experience a stronger sense of disorientation due to decreased societal tethers.
- Political parties capitalize on this disorientation by promising a return to the past, offering a nostalgic vision of a more familiar and recognizable world.
- This nostalgia becomes a powerful motivator, appealing to people's desire for stability and a sense of belonging in a rapidly changing world.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>\"Ezra Klein\"</b><br/><br/>When I was reading your book, though, another word was used in passing, disorientation. And I've been thinking a lot about that word because the people I know who are of this political tendency, what I hear most often from them is a kind of disorientation. The way all this change is experienced across a variety of domains from how many immigrants there are to what you can say about race to gender fluidity, all the way up to things like inflation And the Fed and quantitative easing. There's just this constant sense of disorientation, which is also why I think the generation gap dimension is very important. As you get older, and particularly if you're older without a lot of tethers into society, right, maybe you don't work anymore, you don't, you know, see the people you used to see, it just Feels like things are changing very rapidly. And what often seems to me to unite the parties that respond to this tendency is a kind of promise that they will solve disorientation by making things the way they were. America, we're going to make America great again. We're going to have an economy built on manufacturing and coal. It has materialistic appeals at times, but also appeals around gender and gender identity and race. But at its core is a kind of nostalgic promise that you won't have to feel like your own country has changed in a way that you don't recognize it and it doesn't recognize you.</blockquote>

### [01:12:02] Left Parties' Dilemma

**Left Parties' Dilemma**

- Traditional left-wing parties face a challenge: focusing on economic policies may not resonate with voters driven by cultural anxieties.
- While parties can expand social services, improve infrastructure, and promote green jobs, cultural issues divide them internally.
- These parties struggle to balance support for progressive values with appealing to a more traditional working-class base.
- Unlike center-right parties that can form coalitions with populist groups, left-leaning parties find it difficult to compromise on cultural issues, making it hard to address anxieties effectively.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Pippa Norris</b><br/><br/>And in the new green industries, all of that is a set of assumptions that social democratic parties on the left are very comfortable with. Problem is that it's not clear that this is the driver of the support, if it's the cultural issues. And the problem about the cultural issues is that the parties on the left are totally divided internally. Issues like reproductive rights, on issues like diversity and immigration, on issues like changing immigration policies or backtracking, for example, on LGBTQ rights, it's impossible For many of these parties to consider diluting or reversing some of those liberal gains. And they can't also thereby appeal to the classic working class base, which is very much more traditional and more conservative on those sorts of issues. So they're stuck within a rock and a hard place. And I think this is their fundamental dilemma. It's far easier for the parties on the centre-right to adapt. They can basically go into bed with the populist parties and they can change the immigration policies, which they have. That's the big area where populist parties have made a big success in Western Europe. And they can also continue with their economic policies, which are fairly libertarian, tax cuts and things like that. And, you know, you can have a coalition which is kind of accommodated. But left parties have to go into bed with Greens. They can't basically have any sort of compromise with the authoritarian populist parties. It's just impossible in their makeup.</blockquote>

**B2B SaaS Explosion**

- The rise of cloud and mobile computing led to a boom in B2B SaaS companies.
- Unlike mass consumer apps, where incumbents often won, or entirely novel consumer ideas, the B2B SaaS space saw the creation of hundreds of billion-dollar companies.
- This proliferation is attributed to the lack of a single dominant player in the SaaS market, unlike the existence of giants like Microsoft in traditional software.
- The fragmented nature of the SaaS landscape, with diverse verticals and products, allowed many smaller companies to thrive.

And so like by number of logos, way more billion dollar companies were created in that third category than the first two. I think one reason why that happened is, like, there is no, like, Microsoft of SaaS. Like, there is no company that somehow does, like, SaaS for, like, every vertical and every product. Like, for structural reasons, it seems to be the case that, like, they're all different companies.

**Vertical SaaS UX Advantage**

- Enterprise software like Oracle and NetSuite often suffers from poor user experience because they try to be everything to everyone.
- Vertical SaaS companies can create a much better user experience by focusing on a specific niche.
- This 10x improvement in UX is possible because of the gap between consumer and enterprise software design.

<blockquote><b>Diana Hu</b><br/><br/>Other problem is that with a lot of this enterprise software if you're a user of Oracle and a NetSuite, because they have to cover so much ground, the user experience is actually pretty Bad. They're trying to be jack of all trades but master of none. So it ends up being a bit of a kitchen sink type of experience. And this is where if you go and build a B2B SaaS vertical company, you could do literally a 10x better experience and more delightful because there's this stark difference between consumer Products and enterprise user experience.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jared Friedman</b><br/><br/>Well, there's only, what, three price points in software. It's $5 per seat, $500 per seat, or $5,000 per seat. And that maps directly to consumer SMB or enterprise sales. And then I think time immemorial has taught us that in the past, and this is less and less true with new software, thankfully, but enterprise is terrible software because it's not the User buying it. You know, some high up muckety-muck inside a Fortune 1000 is the person who's getting wined and dined for this, you seven figure contract. And, you know, they're going to choose something that maybe isn't that good, actually, for the end user, the person who has to actually use the software day to day. And I'm sort of curious to see how this changes with LLMs, actually. I mean, to date, one of the more</blockquote>

**Selling AI to Enterprises**

- When selling AI software to enterprises, target decision-makers high enough in the organization to avoid resistance from teams fearing replacement.
- Teams whose jobs are at risk will sabotage AI implementations.
- Aim for top-down adoption and potentially even CEO sign-off to ensure successful integration.

**CEO Voice Chat**

- A CEO created a voice chat as a weekend project that called all 1500 of their employees.
- The calls were short, and the AI extracted meaning from employee ramblings to give the CEO a bulleted summary of the important stuff.
- This concept is reminiscent of the movie *Her*, where the OS speaks to thousands of people concurrently.
- The ability for large language models to have conversations could extend the capability of a few people to understand what's happening within a large organization.

**Bitcoin as Dollar-Denominated Asset**

- Bitcoin currently behaves like a dollar-denominated asset, similar to a gold proxy.
- It's important to recognize this reality for proper risk management, even if you believe it will eventually become an independent store of value.

### [26:46] M&A and IPOs in 2025


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (25:13 - 26:51)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ad236b0-4d30-4246-b81c-bc2b3ccfc33b)


**M&A and IPOs in 2025**

- Chamath Palihapitiya predicts subdued M&A and IPO activity in 2025, especially in the first half, due to high interest rates making alternative investments like T-bills more attractive.
-  He argues that relying on regulatory changes for M&A betrays the importance of strong industrial logic.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Then on the M&A side, if all you're doing is waiting for Lina Khan to not be there, to me, I think that that betrays what M&A is supposed to be, which is you're supposed to underwrite some Industrial logic from first principles where things are very accretive and very accretive things should not hang by a thread on the emotional regulation or dysregulation of the FTC Commissioner. I kind of think that you would have seen some of this stuff already as well if the industrial logic was so high. And again, when rates are non-trivially high, I just think that it's not the easiest thing in the world to pull off like a really big M&A event, nor is it a really easy thing to pull off to Pull off a huge IPO. Again, there's a reason why Warren Buffett has $325 billion sitting in T-bills, making 4.5% a year. He owns more T-bills than the United States government. He's making about $15 billion a year in interest. When you can do that with absolutely no risk, again, relative to stocks at least, What is this IPO going to give you?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Chamath's right. Like the 10 years at four and a half percent, you're basically paying 20 times cash flow to own a risk-free bond, the US Treasury bond.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Or you can pay 23 times to own a totally risky asset. Yeah. It's 30 times to own the S&P 500 right now. It's nuts.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Yeah. But there is a lot of risk seeking shifting happening, right? So I mean, we talked about like some of the crypto stuff, some of the fintech stuff, deregulation, that the PE might seem high today.</blockquote>

### [49:57] Ocrevus for MS

**Ocrevus for MS**

- David Friedberg mentioned Ocrevus, a new drug for multiple sclerosis, as an example of a beneficial drug advertised directly to consumers. 
- This advertising creates awareness and prompts patients to consult their doctors, especially those not seeing their doctors regularly.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>I think that there are drugs, like multiple sclerosis is a good example. There was a drug introduced a couple of years ago called Octrovis, and it was a new therapy for multiple sclerosis that is extremely effective. It's a really big step change in biological therapies. And a lot of people that were on MS and have had MS for decades take kind of old school drugs that maybe aren't that effective. So to create awareness, and they're not regularly seeing their doctors. They may not go in and see their doctor every year like they're supposed to. So the pharma companies are creating awareness that there's this new modality and this new product that could help them to get them to go into the doctor's office.</blockquote>

**Pharma and Media**

- Pharma companies spend heavily on news outlets because they profit from government insurance programs that don't negotiate drug prices.
- This creates a system of regulatory capture, inflating drug costs.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think the question you have to ask is, why is so much money going from pharma to these news outlets? Because most of the products, you know, that you generally can't buy them.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>I'll tell you the reason. The reason is that the pharma companies make so much money off of government funded insurance programs. Let me just state that again. If we only had private insurance, or if consumers had to pay for their drugs and their therapies themselves, the cost of drugs would go way down. The reason the cost of drugs has gone way up is because so much of the government insurance programs don't negotiate drug prices. And there are all these middlemen and all these people that sit in between that have been regulated through regulatory capture into the system that has allowed an incredible inflation In the cost of drug prices. Therefore, there is a lot of money to kind of continue the capture of the system. I don't think that it is right. And I think that the free market generally or having a less regulatory captured market will allow an appropriate kind of pricing of therapies and appropriate kind of adjustment in The market, which doesn't exist today. So so much money to kind of keep the market the way it is needs to kind of keep flowing. That's my sense of this. I don't think it's about bad drugs need to kind of stay in play as much as it is this market's been allowed to inflate and the cost of healthcare and the cost of drugs has inflated in a way That's simply untenable. And it doesn't make sense. And I think that it's because of regulatory capture. And I think that that needs to change.</blockquote>

### [01:15:46] Trump as an Extinction Event


[üéß Play snip - 4minÔ∏è (01:11:33 - 01:15:46)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34145f29-cdd6-4fee-98f0-a4e69cb0823b)


**Trump as an Extinction Event**

- Trump's appointments represent a sort of 'extinction event' for the federal government, analogous to biological extinction events that reset ecosystems.
- Existing agencies and processes will be rigorously tested by disruptive, oppositional forces.
- Those that survive will be stronger and more resilient, leading to a potentially very different government structure.
- This process, though potentially painful in the short term, is necessary to address issues like overspending and inefficiency.
- Like punctuated equilibrium in biology, this disruption could lead to a more robust and adaptable system.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>So I think there's this kind of thing that happens in biology called evolution. And a lot of people think evolution is this continuous process, but it's not. Evolution is this process by which there is some significant growth for a period of time. And then there is an extinction event or an external force that causes what ultimately becomes what's called punctuated equilibrium. So the whole kind of system resets and then the healthier, stronger species survive and they grow and they persist. And if you look at the first chart, Nick, that I pulled up, this will just show you guys past extinction events. Large amounts of biomass over the past half billion years get wiped out when these extinction events occur. And then evolution occurs because the species that can survive the extinction event persist in the environment and they grow. And that's how evolution kind of actually takes place is there's an external force that changes what survives and what doesn't. It's kind of a testing force. If you look at federal spending, and this is a crazy link, but here's federal spending over the last couple of decades. And I would argue that many of the agencies, much of the bureaucracy, many of the jobs created, many of the spending programs, many of the operating models, many of the behaviors can Kind of be viewed as a species or species within this ecosystem that have kind of grown a lot over the last few decades. And I think what Trump's mandate was by the people, and people don't want to hear this, and they don't like it, but his mandate was to be kind of the extinction event. And whatever agencies, whatever operating processes, whatever individuals, whatever bureaucratic systems exist within the federal government that can withstand the scrutiny Of the individuals that Trump is going to put in charge of each of these agencies, that they can survive and they can come out the other end. There is certainly some degree of strength and resilience and hardiness. This is not about right or wrong. I'm saying they deserve to exist if they can survive. I'm saying this is going to bring in the most disruptive force that federal agencies have ever seen. And the intention with Trump isn't to find some person to keep running things the way they have been run in the past. His mandate from the people who elected him, based on the message he put out there, is to do the opposite, which is to go in and be as disruptive and damaging and destructive as possible. And whatever comes out the other side will be stronger, will be hardier, and theoretically, will be, you know, more resilient. And I think that that's the event that's underway. Now, the people who are getting exactly what they want in Trump's candidacies are the Democrats. They were saying Trump is going to put a bunch of crazy lunatics in office, and he's going to make them the cabinet. And they're good. And now they're able to kind of clap their hands and say, we told you so we told you so. And I'm not sure that if they're really getting the message, which is that the intention here isn't to keep things running the way they have been running, but to really fundamentally Test the systems and test the systems with the most challenging oppositional forces the systems have ever been tested by, which is the candidates or the individuals that he's putting In charge of each of these agencies. So I'm not saying it's right or wrong one way or the other, but I'm making an observation that this is going to be kind of an extinction level event that Trump's decisions on who he's putting In place, I think, are going to drive an outcome on the other end that's going to make the government look very different. And I'm not going to sit around and say, this person's good, this person's bad, because I don't think the point is to find someone that's, quote, qualified to do the job. The intention is actually quite different. And the outcome may actually be positive for America, if you fast forward a couple of years, in some cases, and there's some cases where things could get really messed up, and people Could suffer, and jobs will be lost, and all sorts of bad things will happen. But we cannot continue the way we have to with respect to federal spending, with respect to federal spending, bureaucracy and inefficiency in the federal government. And so something has to happen. And if this is the path by which this gets resolved in the limited window, that's in front of this particular administration, which is probably two years, maybe four, maybe this is what Has to happen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>Shabbat, where do you stand on Freeberg's</blockquote>

### [02:06] Decline of Bipartisan Consensus in US Foreign Policy

**Decline of Bipartisan Consensus in US Foreign Policy**

- The bipartisan consensus on US foreign policy, dominant until around 2012, has eroded.
- This consensus, centered on containing communism and promoting free trade, shaped alliances and global economic growth.

<blockquote><b>Peter Zeihan</b><br/><br/>Not have a great answer. In the world until roughly, oh, let's call it 2012, we had something in the United States when it came to foreign policy and strategic policy called the bipartisan consensus. And the idea was that the Soviet Union was bad, global communism was not a great idea, and the way for the United States to secure its security, as well as its economic well-being, was To build an alliance network that would span the world and pursue a free trade world, a globalized world with everyone, so that most countries of consequence would have a vested interest In benefiting from participating in the American security agreements rather than going and doing something else. And that gave us NATO and the Japanese and the Korean and Taiwanese alliances and all of that, and built the non-aligned world into an economic powerhouse that wasn't necessarily aligned With the United States, but really wasn't aligned with anyone else either. Broadly worked. But then in 2012, we had eight years of a visceral disinterest in governing by Barack Obama. And then we got Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who were two of the most economically populous presidents we've ever had. And over that 16-year period, the bipartisan consensus has withered away. And the party that was responsible for basically writing most of the real policies, the Republican Party, has now found itself in a different place, with the national security conservatives And the business conservatives not really even part of the party architecture any longer. And there are some factions of the Republican Party that are finding themselves very strangely aligned on some issues with Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>John Mackey</b><br/><br/>But when we were going up there to talk about maybe Amazon buying Whole Foods, you know, we were meeting at Jeff's boathouse, which was next to his mansion on Lake Washington. And, and, but when we, they wouldn't tell us who the meeting place was until we landed. And then they gave us an address. When we got there, we were searched. Our car was searched because they were worried about somebody trying to kill Jeff. And I was thinking to myself, I would never want to be so rich and so famous and so powerful that I couldn't live a normal life, that I didn't have any anonymity. That was like a real wake-up call. It's like, I'm sure Jeff's one of the most envied people in the world, but I would not want to have to live my life like that. So a little bit of fame, a little bit of money, a little bit of power to a certain point is gratifying to the soul. But past that point, you get diminishing returns. It's no longer bringing you any kind of happiness. It's now a burden. So I got clear about death at a pretty young age and I just wanted to accomplish things. And I didn't think my accomplishments were that big a deal. Other people are accomplishing stuff as well. So I didn't spend a lot of time comparing myself to others, either people that had less or had more. I was too busy creating the next painting because that was what was fun. That was what was exciting. That was where the joy and the love came. And then the relationships with the people that you're doing it with. That's the real satisfying part.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>John Mackey</b><br/><br/>Everybody that gets to the, and they're on their deathbed. Imagine you're on your deathbed. Do you think you'll be thinking, I wish I'd made more money. I wish I'd been richer. I wish I'd been more famous. I wish I'd had more power. No, you're going to be thinking about, I wish I'd told my son how much I loved him. I wish I hadn't let that relationship go. I wish I hadn't said those things. Your regrets are always going to be about relationships and the ways that love failed in your life. I mean, that's the clearest indication that love's the most important thing is because that's what happens when you're dying is you're looking back and you're thinking about the people That you loved and didn't love well enough. You're not thinking about the other shit. You've let it go. And so I've just been clear about that for a long time.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Shane Parrish</b><br/><br/>How do you learn to love yourself? There's always like an inner critic, right? To love yourself unconditionally.</blockquote>

**Capitalism's Impact**

- Over the past 250 years, capitalism has dramatically improved living standards, life expectancy, literacy, and child mortality.
- Despite current challenges, these advancements signify significant progress compared to historical hardships.

<blockquote><b>John Mackey</b><br/><br/>But just 200 years ago, these statistics tell you all you need to know. 200 years ago, 94% of everyone alive on the planet lived on less than $2 a day in today's dollars. 85% lived on less than $1 a day. The average lifespan was a 30. Oh, by the way, so let's give it to today, only 6% of the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. It's gone from 94% to 6% in the last 250 years. The average lifespan 200 years ago was 30. Now, it's across the planet, it's getting closer to 80. We've gone from about 77. I think it's 76 for men and 78 for women across the whole planet from 30. Illiteracy rates 200 years ago, 88% of the people alive couldn't read. Now it's under 10%. And childbirth, I mean, child deaths and child deaths, children dying before their age of 10. The type of advancements we've made in vaccines, in antibiotics, modern dentistry, the amazing innovations that we have today, and music. And it's the world is so much better than it was. The people that complain about the world being a disaster don't put it in a historical context. Do we have problems today? Sure we do. Of course we do. We always will have problems, by the way. But these are different problems than we had. When people talk about existential threat of climate, the existential threats are far less today than they were 200 years ago.

### [06:29] Progress Predicted Through the Ages


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (04:39 - 06:31)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e29bbbd8-d3bc-4dd6-9914-7b6b73850dfe)




### ‚ú® Summary
The seeds of the concept of technological singularity trace back to Samuel Butler's works in the late 19th century, where he envisioned autonomous machine life as a potential threat to humanity. Notably, he proposed that war should be declared on such machines. This foresight was remarkable for its time. Similarly, Isaac Newton observed a rapid technological progress in his era, theorizing that it was due to civilizational resets every few millennia, implying that true continuous acceleration might be impossible because knowledge resets with civilization's destruction. The thoughts of Lucretius also echoed this skepticism regarding progress, reflecting a historical pattern of questioning the validity of technological acceleration. These insights highlight a long-standing dialogue about the nature of progress, innovation, and existential risks associated with technological advancement.

<blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>By when could one have foreseen the singularity?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Dwarkesh Patel</b><br/><br/>So obviously, Moravac and others are talking about it in the 80s and 90s. But when was the earliest you could have seen where things are headed?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>I think if you want to trace the genealogy there, you'd probably have to go back at least as far as Samuel Butler's Erewhon in 1872, or his essay before that. I mean, in 1863, he described explicitly his vision of a machine life becoming ever more developed until eventually it's autonomous, at which point it's a threat to the human race. And he concluded war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. That seemed really prescient for 1863. I'm not sure that anyone is given a clear singularity scenario earlier than that. The idea of technological progress was still relatively new at that point. I love this example of Isaac Newton looking at the rate of progress in Newton's time in his own contemporary time and going, wow, there's something really strange here. Stuff is being invented now around us. We're making progress. How is that possible? And then coming up with the answer, well, progress must be possible now because civilization gets destroyed every couple of thousand years. And all we're doing is reinventing and rediscovering the old stuff. That was actually his explanation for technological acceleration. We can't actually have any kind of real technological acceleration. It must be because the world gets destroyed periodically and we just can't see past the last reset.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Dwarkesh Patel</b><br/><br/>You know, it almost is like Fermi's paradox, but for different civilizations across time with respect to each other instead of aliens across space.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>Yeah, yeah. It turns out even Lucretius, around 1700 years before that, was writing the same argument. He said, look at all these wonderful innovations and arts and sciences that we Romans have compiled together in the Roman Empire. This is amazing, but it can't actually be a recent acceleration technology. Could that be real? Could there be progress?</blockquote>

### [18:24] Neglecting Insight Leads to Missed Opportunities

### ‚ú® Summary
Insufficient attention to previous scaling results hindered progress in understanding model improvement. The discovery from DeepMind regarding Bayesian optimization and its impact on eliminating tree search is crucial yet overlooked. Furthermore, the 2017 Baidu paper on scaling laws, which emphasized the continuing relevance of scaling, was underestimated and neglected due to its lack of immediate implications. The prevailing misconception that algorithms outweigh compute in importance resulted from a misrepresentation of research origins, where papers failed to accurately reflect the true process of idea development.

<blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>I think for the most part, they were suffering from two issues. First, I think they hadn't really been paying attention to all of the scaling results before, which were relevant. They hadn't really appreciated the fact that, for example, AlphaZero was discovered in part by DeepMind doing Bayesian optimization on hyperparameters and noticing that you could Just get rid of more and more of the tree search and get better models. That was a critical insight, I think, which could only have been gained by having so much compute power that you could afford to train many, many versions see the difference that that Made. Similarly, I think they, those people kind of simply just like didn't know about the Baidu paper on scaling laws from 2017, which showed that the scaling laws just keep going, going Forever, practically. It should have been the most important paper of the year. But I think that, you know, a lot of people just didn't prioritize it. It didn't have any immediate implication, and so it sort of just got forgotten. People were too busy discussing transformers or alpha zero or something at the time to really notice it. So that was one issue. And I think another issue is that they shared the basic error that I was making about algorithms being more important than compute. This was in part, I think, due to a systematic falsification of the actual origins of ideas in the research literature. Papers don't tell you where the ideas come from in a truthful manner, right? They just tell you a nice sounding story about how it was discovered. They don't tell you how it's actually discovered.</blockquote>

### [28:06] Write to Shape the Future

### ‚ú® Summary
Engaging in writing serves as a means to influence the future, particularly in relation to AI developments like 'the Shoggoth.' It emphasizes that passive citizenship lacks impact; mere participation in traditional civic duties does not hold weight in shaping the future. For those who are not in pivotal roles within advanced fields, their ability to influence becomes negligible. Expressing personal values and desires through text is critical, as any unarticulated thoughts are effectively nonexistent to AI systems, which can lead to a dangerous cultural erasure. Additionally, writing contributes to personal legacy, as one's online persona and expressed thoughts become a reflection of their future self, impacting how AI treats them moving forward.

<blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>By writing, you're voting on the future of the Shoggoth using some of the few currencies it acknowledges, right? Like tokens that it has to predict. If you aren't writing, you're kind of abdicating the future or abdicating your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, you know, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you. There are ways to influence the Shoggoth more, but not many. And if you don't already occupy a handful of key roles or work at a frontier lab, your influence basically rounds off to zero, I think far more than ever before. If there are values you have, which are not expressed yet in text, and if there are things that you like or want, if they aren't reflected online, then to the AI, they basically don't exist. And that is dangerously close to won't exist. You're also creating a sort of immortality for yourself personally, right? Like you aren't just creating a persona, you are creating your future self too, right? What self are you showing the LLMs and how will they treat you in the future?</blockquote>

### [53:19] Agency in LLMs


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (51:54 - 53:19)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09f40ca4-1077-4259-893f-21edf1675348)


**Agency in LLMs**

- Agency in LLMs is easier to achieve than predicted, but current systems don't directly learn it.
- Current agency is a byproduct of training on internet data, not direct selection or reinforcement learning.
- LLMs achieve surprising success given they're trained on individual letters and not coherent actions.
- The lack of proper reinforcement learning training data for agentic workflows is a major bottleneck for LLM development.


#### üìö Transcript
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Gwern Branwen</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I think agency is in many senses actually easier to learn than we would have thought 10 years ago. But we actually aren't really learning agency at all in current systems. There's no kind of like selection for that. All the agency there is is an accidental byproduct instead of somebody training on data. So from that perspective, it's miraculous that you could ask an LLM to try to do all these things and they have a non-trivial success rate. If you told people 10 years ago, I think that you could just behavior clone on individual letters following one by one, and then you would get this coherent action out of it and control Robots and write entire programs, their jaws would drop. And they would just say that you've been huffing too many fumes from DeepMind or something. The reason that agency doesn't work is that we just have so little actual training data for it. An example of how you would do agency directly would be like Gato from DeepBind. There, they're actually training agents. Instead, we train them on these internet scrapes, which merely encode the outputs of agents or occasional descriptions of agents doing things, that kind of thing. There's no actual like logging of state environments, result reward trip sequences like a proper kind of reinforcement learning setup would have. I would say that what's more interesting actually is that nobody wants to train agents in a proper reinforcement learning way today. Instead, everyone wants to train LLMs and then do everything with as little RL as possible on the back end.</blockquote>

So there's about 18 companies that are dominant in the materials and packaging, which is so essential, that have anywhere from 40 to 70% of worldwide share of market in their space. And when you think of the people that make machines for the semiconductor, there's ASML in the Netherlands, Tokyo Electron here. And so they have a lot that is a specialty, but you could get overwhelmed and biased from the writing. And I'm not sure it's 100% accurate. And then it skews the way you interpret stuff. And it's in kind of early stage velocity now back. There's a much higher debt than we're carrying in the U.S., right?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Isn't it?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Rahm Emanuel</b><br/><br/>Much higher than anybody else. I mean, there's like 200 plus percent. On the other hand, they do have that we don't have, $22 trillion, not yet, in savings. So while their debt is extremely high from a GDP standpoint, their savings is off the chart. Now, that's the good news. The bad news, it's earning, up until this point, zero interest rate, and it's sitting, as our grandparents would do, in the mattress. There was no 401k, no savings type of, no allocation of capital. I sound like I was listening to Larry Summers when I was at the White House. But the use of capital is not the most efficient.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>So from your perch here, how are you viewing our growing competition with China?</blockquote>

So it asked for that judgment, and it should. And it has had days in which it has achieved that. I don't think, and achieved that in those days, it's fallen short of that, of its own standard. But I always remind people, you know, in the situation they have on Gaza and the situation they have on the North, you know, you have a country that uses missiles to protect its people, Fighting a force that uses people to protect its missiles. It's very different. And then you treat them morally equal. Second, you had two perpetrators, one clearly raped and mutilated women and children. And another where the case may have been, and they were honored. And the other one where there may have been in prisons, it looks like there was, sexual abuse and rape, and they've been arrested and are going to be held by a criminal. So they're not morally equal, but you treat them morally equal. And I'm sorry.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>I'm asking why that, because the double standard is so shocking and gallant.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Rahm Emanuel</b><br/><br/>But there is, Israel asked for a standard, and I'm glad they did.

### [22:07] Tariffs can be used strategically to promote domestic industries and determine what a country produces.

<blockquote><b>Sohrab Ahmari</b><br/><br/>And the thing to remember is what are tariffs for? The tariffs are aimed at promoting certain domestic industries. It's basically saying, what do we want to produce in this country? What do we not, what products do we not want to give up the production of in this country? Whether that's for strategic reasons, whether it's because, and I believe this, that manufacturing is associated with just a different kind of job, right? Gigafied, precarious service jobs don't have the same stability and dignity and actually, frankly, higher wages that are associated with manufacturing jobs. So that's part of it. There's a pro-labor component to it. There is a national security component to it. And there's just industrial know-how, right? What we've learned as we're trying to, for example, arm Israel and Ukraine is that, you know, even as Congress is throwing more and more money, whether you agree with those policies Or not, I don't want to get into the substance of it. But even as Congress is throwing money into the Pentagon to build more shells and stuff, it takes time to ramp that up. Why? Because for two decades, we neglected our industrial base. And we have workers whose skills have atrophied, who've lost the game in terms of workforce development. So these are the goals that you want to address with tariffs. And if you have that in mind, then you can be strategic about it. You can say, okay, well, on some areas, yeah, we still want to be able to, you know, take advantage of comparative advantage, especially when there's, as you say, a real fair trade, you Know, you have a fair play going on, and not one side playing a mercantilist game while we're pretending like we live in, you know, Milton Friedman's utopia? Fine, you know, we can have that. As long as, for example, those third countries that we consider allies don't become platforms for Chinese investments that are aimed at doing the same thing they were doing before, Which is undermining our industrial base.</blockquote>

Like I said, in the late 18th century, there was this period of called the masterless men, artisans, yeoman farmers, etc., who would deal with each other at arm's length. And really, that picture that I just described really described the reality. But ever since the Industrial Revolution, most sectors are dominated by a handful of large players. The name that the economist Joan Robinson coined for this is oligopoly. It's not monopoly. Even free marketeers agree that monopoly should be curbed. It's oligopoly. It's just two or three players. So that like by the late 19th century, Otis Elevator controlled 90% of its market. British American tobacco controlled 70% of its market, et cetera, et cetera. When you're dealing in a situation like that, the economy is coercive because the price is no longer this pristine index of supply and demand, but rather an index of relative bargaining Power between consumers and sellers, between employers and employees and so on. Can I pause you there because I think you and I are tracking each other well.</blockquote>

- Modern capitalism necessitates large concentrations of power due to factors like factory and network effects.
-  These effects promote bigness and consolidation, making intense price competition and a multitude of small sellers impractical.

<blockquote><b>Sohrab Ahmari</b><br/><br/>So that's the reality of modern capitalism. And that's fine. Like I said, it's rational in many ways. We don't want intense price competition, all that kind of 19th century capitalism, because it's destabilizing and, you know, there's all the sort of wild cycles and so on that we live Through in the 19th century. So we realize we're going to have these kind of consolidated, enormous concentrations of power. However, if we're going to have them, then we should countervail their power by other forces in society, labor unions, one, and of course, government, administrators, and so on, regional Wage boards, civil society, non-profit. This is the model of mid-century America, which coincided with this period of great, like I said, productivity and dynamism and mass prosperity. Now, I don't see how in 2024 conditions have changed. Capitalism in an industrial age will just involve large concentrations. And we need socially to be able to sort of exert our will over these entities, even as they benefit us. And I realize that they benefit us. So that's the theory. And I just don't think you say, well, just because it was enacted in 1934, it doesn't mean that it's, well, the basic kind of conditions of industrial capitalism haven't changed.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Vivek Ramaswamy</b><br/><br/>Look, I think that where we find a lot of common ground in the framing of the discussion is a menu of options of imperfect systems or imperfect alternatives.

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>If I'm talking to Siddhartha Mukherjee about cancer, it is only decent and sane for me to acknowledge, if merely tacitly by asking questions and listening to the answers, that he, being A celebrated oncologist, knows more about cancer than I do.

Relying on authority can produce errors, of course, in the same way that some of the money in your wallet could prove to be counterfeit, but not relying on it, shunning it, just, quote, Doing one's own research, is guaranteed to produce more errors, at least in the aggregate.

**Misinformation and Political Cults**

- Misinformation, often spread through misleading clips, is driving us insane.
- Many people still believe the edited clip of Trump praising neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, despite it being a lie debunked by Sam Harris.
- This is not about scoring points but upholding ethical and intellectual integrity, crucial against figures like Trump and Elon Musk.
- These figures, and their cults, are unconcerned with truth or the harm they cause.
- They actively contribute to societal delirium and the destruction of institutions through lies and misinformation.

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>As I've pointed out many times before, if you watch Trump's remarks in context, you will see that the claim that he was praising neo-Nazis and white supremacists is a lie. And I have debunked this lie many, many times, both on this podcast and in print, to the consternation of people on the left who just want to score points against Trump and Trumpism without Any concern for their own ethical or intellectual integrity. Needless to say, I've done this not out of any love for Trump or his influence on our politics, but out of a hatred for lies. But Trump and Elon and the cults that they have built are comfortable with lies and half-truths and endless bullshit. They are perfectly content to watch our political culture succumb to an algorithmically mediated delirium, and they seem to have no concern about destroying important institutions, And in many cases declare themselves eager to destroy them. Again, I'm not rooting for these guys to fail, and nothing I've said here is predicated on the conviction that they will.

> Democrats once seemed to have a monopoly on Silicon Valley. Perhaps you remember when Elon Musk bought Twitter and posted pictures of cabinets at the old office filled with  ‚Äú#StayWoke‚Äù T-shirts .<br/>>   <br/>>  But just as the country is realigning itself along new ideological and political lines, so is the tech capital of the world. In 2024, many of the Valley‚Äôs biggest tech titans came out with their unabashed support for Donald Trump. There was, of course, Elon Musk .¬†.¬†.¬† but also WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum; Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who run the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini; VCs such as Shaun Maguire, David Sacks, and Chamath Palihapitiya; Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale; Oculus and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey; hedge fund manager Bill Ackman; and today‚Äôs  Honestly  guest, one of the world‚Äôs most influential investors and the man responsible for bringing the internet to the masses‚ÄîMarc Andreessen.¬†<br/>>   <br/>>  Marc‚Äôs history with politics is a long one‚Äîbut it was always with the Democrats. He supported Democrats including Bill Clinton in 1996, Al Gore in 2000, and John Kerry in 2004. He endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and then Hillary Clinton in 2016.<br/>>   <br/>>  But over the summer, he announced that he was going to endorse and donate to Trump. Public records show that Marc donated at least $4.5 million to pro-Trump super PACs. Why? Because he believed that the Biden administration had, as he tells us in this conversation, ‚Äúseething contempt‚Äù for tech, and that this election was existential for AI, crypto, and start-ups in America.¬†<br/>>   <br/>>  Marc got his start as the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, which is said to have launched the internet boom. He then co-founded Netscape, which became the most popular web browser in the ‚Äô90s, and sold it to AOL in 1999 for $4.2 billion.<br/>>   <br/>>  He later became an angel investor and board member at Facebook. And in 2006, when everyone told Mark Zuckerberg to  sell Facebook to Yahoo for $1 billion , Marc was the only voice saying: don‚Äôt. (Today, Facebook has a market cap of $1.4 trillion.)<br/>>   <br/>>  He now runs a venture capital firm with Ben Horowitz, where they invest in small start-ups that they think have potential to become billion-dollar unicorns. And their track record is pretty spot-on: They invested in Airbnb, Coinbase, Instagram, Instacart, Pinterest, Slack, Reddit, Lyft, and Oculus‚Äîto name a few of the unicorns. (And for full disclosure: Marc and his wife were small seed investors in  The Free Press .)<br/>>   <br/>>  Marc has built a reputation as someone who can recognize ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù in tech and, more broadly, in our lives. He has been called the ‚Äúchief ideologist of the Silicon Valley elite,‚Äù a ‚Äúcultural tastemaker,‚Äù and even ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äôs resident philosopher-king.‚Äù<br/>>   <br/>>  Today, Bari and Marc discuss his reasons for supporting Trump‚Äîand the vibe shift in Silicon Valley; why he thinks we‚Äôve been living under soft authoritarianism over the last decade and why it‚Äôs finally cracking; why he‚Äôs so confident in Elon Musk and his band of counter-elites; how President Biden tried to kill tech and control AI; why he thinks AI censorship is ‚Äúa million times more dangerous‚Äù than social media censorship; why technologists are the ones to restore American greatness; what Trump serves for dinner; why Marc has spent about half his time at Mar-a-Lago since November 5; and why he thinks it‚Äôs morning in America.<br/>>   <br/>>  If you liked what you heard from Honestly, the best way to support us is to go to¬† TheFP.com ¬†and become a Free Press subscriber today.<br/>>   <br/>>  This show is proudly sponsored by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).

### [24:52] Preference Falsification in Tech

**Preference Falsification in Tech**

- Many in tech publicly falsified their political preferences due to fear of social and professional consequences. 
- This involved both concealing true beliefs and expressing false ones. 
- Marc Andreessen highlights the damaging effects of this, referencing V√°clav Havel's essay "The Power of the Powerless" and the practice of displaying slogans in communist regimes.

<blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>Easy version of the story, I think the easy answer is there was a lot of what was called preference falsification happening. And so there were some number of true believers on the blue side, and then there were some number of true believers on the red side. But the true believers on the red side were lying in public about what they believe because of the threat of social sanction and career obliteration and losing their friends and family And everything else.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>And just for the listener, that's what preference falsification means. Sort of everyone who listens will be familiar with this phenomenon of like, there are certain things that you'll say to your spouse alone in bed at night that you would never dare to say In the office or on X. Exactly.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>And in fact, there's actually two parts to preference falsification. There's not saying the things that you believe, and then there's being forced to say things you don't believe, right? And of course, there's this famous essay by V√°clav Havel, where he talks about the power of the powerless, and he talks about the role of the slogan in like the communist, you know, behind The Iron Curtain, he talked about the role of the slogan, you know, the...</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>It was the green grocer putting in his window, workers of the world unite.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>Workers of the world unite.

Nobody believes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>But why is the green grocer putting it in his window?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>Exactly, right? And so that's the other side of it, is people saying things that they don't believe. And, you know, these are both bad. Arguably, the second one is</blockquote>

**Government's Role in Tech**

- Bari Weiss posits that government investment paved the way for tech's success, citing investments in the internet, GPS, Tesla, and the California public university system.
- Many tech figures who benefited from this government support now advocate for less government involvement.
- Marc Andreessen acknowledges the government's significant role in R&D, infrastructure, procurement (especially by the Department of Defense), and education, emphasizing that this historically had bipartisan support and was seen as crucial to the American experiment.

<blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>Me ask you then another question about the relationship between government and tech. I think you can very plausibly make the argument that government walks so tech could run. In other words, they invested in the original internet, which made your career. They funded GPS. They gave loans to Tesla to keep Tesla afloat. They fund the California public university system, which arguably gives you employees and also founders to invest in. Essentially, they kind of like built or at least tilled the soil to create a very, very rich environment through which all of these companies could grow. Now a lot of people are in that environment are now turning around and saying, government out of tech. How do you respond to that line of criticism?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>Yeah, so this goes to, I would say this is like a broader version of what I was saying about the deal. The deal for many decades was, precisely as you said, the government invested deeply in R&D. The government invested deeply into infrastructure. The government invested deeply, by the way, procurement, you know, the DOD was the early customer for a lot of these things that made them</blockquote>

**US vs China in Tech**

- The US has the advantages of a decentralized, capitalist system that fosters innovation and free markets.
- China, however, exerts more control, dictating technological development and adoption.
- This control allows them to deploy resources and implement strategies more effectively, giving them an edge in areas like robotics and potentially AI.

<blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>So we have all the advantages of our dynamic system. But they have the advantages of tremendous resources, tremendous control. They can dictate what their companies do. They can dictate what new technologies get developed. They can dictate how those get adopted and used throughout their society. And then they have this, you know, very explicit strategy to take their technology and their culture and their ideology global. And, you know, when their companies go to market globally, they go with their government and their government is able to, you know, provide all kinds of carrots and sticks for countries To adopt their technology. And, you know, our government has been trying to kill us. So, you know, it's the opposite with us. We're doing it with the active opposition of our own government. So China's got lots of really smart people. They're doing very well in AI. They are, you know, I would say ahead of us in robotics. They are probably neck and neck in AI right now. And they are, you know, absolutely determined to win these competitions.</blockquote>

**Right-Wing Critiques of Technology**

- Right-wing critiques of technology focus on its impact on fundamental aspects of humanity like the human spirit, tradition, and social organization.
- These critiques are more interesting and challenging to address than left-wing critiques focused on economic inequality.
- Key issues include technology's connection to secularization and the rise of experts.
- These questions are deep and long-standing, and material prosperity may afford more time and opportunity to address them.

<blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>I think these are, quite frankly, the questions that should be the center of the debate, as opposed to a lot of the other stuff that, you know, at least has been dominating the discourse For the last decade. My claim, you know, that I wrote in my manifesto, my claim is these are all important and valid questions, but, however, the thing you need to always kind of reorient yourself to is questions Of like the human spirit and the social animal and organization of society and religion, like these are deep, kind of permanent questions, you know, that go back many thousands of years. And I don't know that they ever get solved. It may be that these are the questions we need to think about the most, talk about the most. Are we likely to do a better job figuring those things out in a world in which we have higher levels of material prosperity or lower levels of material prosperity? And I think the easy caricatured form of the argument is technology changes society, changing society is bad, therefore we need to dial back on technology, kind of the Luddite argument. The problem with that is you're deliberately then pulling yourself back from economic growth, you're pulling yourself back from growth of standards of living, material prosperity, And then you just have to imagine that, okay, now we're in a better position to answer deep questions of the human soul because we're poorer. I think that's unlikely to be the case. I would be more optimistic that as we get to higher and higher levels of material welfare, we actually have more time, right, and a larger opportunity to address these deeper underlying Questions. And so that's the claim I would make.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>Mark Andreessen, are you ready for a lightning round?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>I'll do my best.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Bari Weiss</b><br/><br/>Okay, best thing about the creation of the internet?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Marc Andreessen</b><br/><br/>Oh, just the explosion of culture.

<blockquote><b>Sara Imari Walker</b><br/><br/>They're not independent lineages. And this is also the case with large language models. Why is it that they have the structure of human language? It's because we were the environment that selected them. And human language had to evolve first in the substrate of human minds and in our writing on paper and then into our computers. And so the kind of information that they have is actually a direct lineage from biological life evolved over billions of years. And so I actually, I think there's more of a continuity between our quote unquote biological life and our technological life on this planet than there is potentially between biological Life on this planet and a different instantiation of alien life and a different chemistry, which would exist in a totally different space of possibilities in</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Sara Imari Walker</b><br/><br/>And also, so you want to ask a question about how big is small molecule chemical space? And in fact, actually, we don't know how many possible molecules there are even for small molecules. There's a whole industry of people that try to work on computing the size of chemical space. And so far, it's been uncomputable. We don't know how big it is. But one question is, could a planet generate every possible small molecule even? And if it generates all possible small molecules, will it discover all of the ones that might place enough constraints on each other to try to build slightly more complex molecules? And the space of slightly more complex molecules is even larger. So for a single planet, we're basically trying to compare combinatorics of like, how many molecules do we expect a typical planet to make per unit time versus how big chemical space Is? And the question is, is chemical space so large? Is the space of all possible molecules so large that even if you had every planet in the universe exhaustively searching, like a random search, you know, what's the density of self-reproducing Structures like us that could emerge from that, sustain themselves long enough to construct the next object and build into this higher complexity space. That's the original life question. And this is one of the reasons that I think that we need to turn the original life into a laboratory experiment that's actually a chemical search through the combinatorial vastness Of chemistry to try to see how likely it is to hit such a structure. And we don't know, we don't even know how big that space is. And</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>That several planks of their platform are thoroughly rotten. Identity politics is over. No one wants it. Latinos and blacks don't even want it, as witnessed by the fact that they moved to Trump in record numbers. Trump got a majority of Latino men nationwide, and in some counties he got got a majority of Latino men and women, even after everything he has said about immigrants from Latin America Over the years. How they're, quote, poisoning the blood of our people, which is right out of Mein Kampf. A comedian calls Puerto Rico a pile of garbage at a Trump rally, and the entire Democratic machine and all of liberal media sees upon it like a nuclear bomb has just vaporized an American City and no one cared. Identity politics is dead, and we have to bury it. There's one species of identity politics that</blockquote>

**De-extinction as a Systems Problem**

- De-extinction involves various aspects like computational analysis, ancient DNA work, field work, computational biology, cellular engineering, genetic engineering, and animal husbandry.
- The current focus is on growing these animals *in vitro* using surrogate mothers.
- A dedicated team is working on developing artificial wombs, though the initial de-extinct species won't use this technology.
- The required tools and technologies for artificial wombs exist; it's about improving scale and efficiency, aiming for later generations to grow fully ex-utero.

**Rewilding Economics and Annuity Potential**

- Rewilded animals can create long-term annuity streams through various avenues.
- These include carbon capture, ecotourism, and biodiversity credits.
- This economic model offers a more sustainable alternative to hunting or poaching.
- Early modeling suggests potential for billions of dollars in annuity value.
- Governments are recognizing this potential and negotiating substantial contracts for rewilding initiatives.

As we're seeing, we're starting to see that transition in Gabon, where people used to just go sell data about the forest elephants to poachers so that they could make money for their Village, right?

<blockquote><b>Bryon Hargis</b><br/><br/>And that's the only way to build fast enough. And you also get a really resilient workforce. The other thing, and probably why we're going to win this market, is every single deep tech company in the history of trying to automate manufacturing has looked at four to 10 big stages Of really expensive labor or coordination across a factory system, whatever product you're trying to build, and said, this is too aggressive. I'm going to build one of these bits first, and then venture capital my way. And eventually I'll build all five of them and it doesn't work. So one, I think we had the right culture, but secondly, you literally just have to build six products simultaneously at a ludicrously aggressive pace.</blockquote>

**Wide and Shallow vs. Deep and Broad Computation**

- Stephen Wolfram contrasts ChatGPT's approach as "wide and shallow" with his own as "deep and broad."
- ChatGPT forages from existing web data, replicating what's already been said.
- Wolfram's goal is to make the world computable, answering questions based on accumulated expert knowledge and potentially computing new things.
- He emphasizes the labor-intensive nature of building computational systems for deep knowledge, compared to using existing data like ChatGPT does.
- This deep computation mirrors the development of formal systems (logic, math, science) in human history, enabling us to work out things not immediately obvious.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I think, you know, as a practical point of view, I view sort of the chat GPT thing as being wide and shallow, and what we're trying to do with sort of building out computation as being This sort of deep also broad but, but most importantly kind of deep type of thing. Another way to think about this is you go back in human history, you know, I don't know, 1000 years or something, and you say what, what, what can the typical person what's the typical Person going to figure out. Well, the answer is there are certain kinds of things that we humans can quickly figure out that's sort of what, what our, you know, at our neural architecture and the kinds of things We learn in our lives, let us do. And then there's this whole layer of kind of formalization that got developed in which is, you know, the kind of whole sort of story of intellectual history and whole kind of depth of Learning that formalization turned into things like logic mathematics, science and so on. And that's the kind of thing that allows one to kind of build these towers of sort of towers of things you work out it's not just I can immediately figure this out. It's no I can use this kind of formalism to go step by step and work out something which was not immediately obvious to me. And that's kind of the story of what we're trying to do computationally is to be able to build those kind of tall towers of what implies what implies what and so on. And as opposed to kind of the yes I can immediately figure it out it's just like what I saw somewhere else in something that was sort of remembered or something like</blockquote>

**Simple Rules Can Lead to Complexity**

- Stephen Wolfram has observed throughout his career that simple rules can produce surprisingly complex outcomes.
- He's been studying this phenomenon for 40 years and is still amazed by it.
- Even with his physics project, where the universe grows from simple rules, he still finds it hard to believe how complexity arises from simplicity.
- Yet, his studies have shown him that this is how things work, as evidenced by ChatGPT generating coherent essays by just predicting the next word.

That something that starts simple and starts simple to describe can grow a thing that is, you know, vastly more complicated than you can imagine. And honestly, it's taken me. I've sort of been thinking about this now 40 years or so. And it always surprises me.

**The Decreasing Value of Specialized Knowledge**

- The value of deep specialized knowledge is decreasing relative to general knowledge and the ability to connect ideas.
- Tools and automation allow access to specialized knowledge without climbing the entire knowledge tower.
- This shift may favor generalists and philosophers who can focus on the bigger picture and defining objectives, while AIs handle the specialized work.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You know, things like the value of big towers of specialized knowledge become less significant compared to the kind of meta knowledge of sort of understanding kind of the big picture And being able to connect things together. And I think that, you know, there's been this huge trend of let's be more and more specialized because we have to, you know, we have to sort of ascend these towers of knowledge. But by the time you can get, you know, more automation, being able to get to that place on the tower without having to go through all those steps. I think it sort of changes that picture.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And since your intuition is that in terms of the collective intelligence of the species and the individual minds they make up that collective, there'll be more, they will trend towards Being generalists and being kind of philosophers.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's what I think.

**Innovation vs. Collective Inertia**

- Innovation involves a complex interplay between individuals pursuing novel ideas and the collective tendency towards established norms.
-  Sometimes the collective fosters interesting developments, while other times it hinders innovative breakthroughs by favoring the high-inertia average.
-  Individuals pursuing 'crazy' outlier ideas are essential for progress, but their efforts can be in tension with the collective's preference for established practices.

**Humans' Role in an AI-Driven Future**

- The increasing prevalence of AI-generated suggestions raises concerns about human agency.
- As AI takes over more tasks, humans might primarily be left with the role of choosing between AI-generated options, rather than generating options themselves.
- This shift highlights the importance of human values and judgment in navigating a future heavily influenced by AI.

And by the way, I mean, you know, at some level, you know, it's all kind of a complicated philosophical issue because at some level, the universe is just doing what it does.

**Abstractions and Perception**

- Different systems have different natural abstractions. 
- A cat's visual perception is probably very similar to ours, despite having only two color receptors. 
- The mantis shrimp, with 15 color receptors, has a much richer color perception of reality. 
- Technology can extend our understanding and perception, e.g., augmented reality can help us perceive infrared and ultraviolet light and extend our web of understanding.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So for a cat, it's, for example, you know, the visual scene that we see, you might, you know, we pick out certain objects, we recognize, you know, certain things in that visual scene, A cat might in principle recognize different things. I suspect, you know, evolution, biological evolution is very slow. And I suspect what a cat notices is very similar. We even know that from some neurophysiology, what a cat notices is very similar to what we notice. Of course, there's a, you know, one obvious difference is cats have only two kinds of color receptors. So they don't see in the same color color that we do. Now, you know, we say we're, we're better, we have three color receptors in a red, green, blue, we're not the overall winner. I think the, the, I think the Mantis shrimp is the overall women winner with 15 color receptors, I think. So it can, it can kind of make distinctions that with our current, you know, like the Mantis shrimp's view of reality is in some, at least in terms of color is much richer than ours. Now, but what's interesting is how do we get there? So imagine we have this augmented reality system that is even, you know, it's seeing into the infrared into the ultraviolet, things like this, and it's translating that into something That is connectable to our brains, either through our eyes or more directly into our brains. You know, then eventually, our kind of web of the types of things we understand will extend to those kinds of constructs, just as they have extended.

### [18:42] Navigating the Duality of Progress


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (17:39 - 18:42)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/938eaad7-f959-4e32-a604-c0efe7adca7b)




### ‚ú® Summary
Technological advancements and the evolution of information systems create a complex interplay that can enhance or undermine human society. While innovations, including AI, have the potential to foster wisdom and empathy, they also risk exacerbating issues like polarization and addiction. The current trajectory suggests that we may face more challenges than benefits, raising critical questions about the net impact of ongoing developments compared to maintaining the status quo.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, this is your urn of invention argument that we spoke about last time. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So there's that where you could focus it, say, on specific technological discoveries. But in parallel with that, there is also this kind of out of control dynamics. You could call it evolution or like kind of a global geopolitical game theoretic situation that is evolving. And our sort of information system, the memetic drivers that have changed presumably quite a lot since we've developed internet and social media. And that is not driving human minds in various different directions. And, you know, if we're lucky, they will make us like wiser and nicer. But there is no guarantee that they won't instead create more polarization or addiction or other various kinds of malfunctions in our collective mind. And so that's kind of the default course, I think. So, yes, AI will also be dangerous, but the relevant standard is how much will it increase the dangers relative to just keep doing what's currently being done.</blockquote>

### [20:35] Navigating the Chaotic Beast of Civilization


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (18:42 - 20:34)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/86c2e63d-db2b-43f9-9395-885f7df34b55)




### ‚ú® Summary
Humanity finds itself on the unpredictable back of a chaotic beast, symbolizing the complex dynamics of our civilization shaped by technology and culture. This beast comprises the interactions of vast numbers of individuals and institutions, leading to a system where no one truly has control. As we strive to influence this environment, the inherent chaos intensifies, especially with advancing technology. The emergence of intelligent machines presents a dual risk: they could either exacerbate the chaotic conditions if poorly designed or, conversely, they could help solve pressing problems that traditional methods cannot address. Thus, the challenge lies in navigating this turbulent landscape while recognizing the potential pitfalls and benefits of increasing intelligence.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Actually, there's a metaphor you use early in the book, the new book, Deep Utopia, which captures this wonderfully. And it's the metaphor of the bucking beast. And I just want to read those relevant sentences because they bring home the nature of this problem, which we tend not to think about in terms that are this vivid. So you say that, quote, humanity is riding on the back of some chaotic beast of tremendous strength, which is bucking, twisting, charging, kicking, rearing. The beast does not represent nature. It represents the dynamics of the emergent behavior of our own civilization. The technology-mediated, culture-inflected, game-theoretic interactions between billions of individuals, groups, and institutions. No one is in control. We cling on as best we can for as long as we can, but at any point, perhaps if we poke the juggernaut the wrong way or for no discernible reason at all, it might toss us into the dust with a quick Shrug or possibly maim or trample us to death. So we have all these variables that we influence in one way or another through culture and through all of our individual actions. And yet, on some basic level, no one is in control. And there's just no, I mean, the system is increasingly chaotic, especially given all of our technological progress. And yes, so into this picture comes the prospect of building more and more intelligent machines. And again, this dual sided risk, there's the risk of building them in a way that contributes to the problem, but there's the risk of failing to build them and failing to solve the problems That might only be solvable in the presence of greater intelligence.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. So that certainly is one dimension of it, I think.</blockquote>

### [23:17] Perfect Technology Tightens Knots of Control

### ‚ú® Summary
Technological advancement can exacerbate systemic issues, akin to tightening knots in string. When technology becomes exceedingly refined, it may enhance the grip of authoritarian regimes, empowering them with tools like surveillance and anti-aging capabilities. This creates a scenario where escaping the entanglement of such a system becomes increasingly difficult. To ultimately unravel the complexities and challenges posed by an advancing technological landscape, it is essential to address foundational governance and ethical issues prior to achieving technological maturity.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Can you explain the analogy to the actual knots in string?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, so the idea is with knots that are just tangled in certain ways, if you just pull hard enough on the ends of that, it kind of straightens out. But there might be other types of problems where if you kind of advance technologically equivalently to tugging on the ends of the string, you end up with this inelimitable knot. And sort of the more perfect the technology, the tighter that knot becomes. So if you have, say you have a kind of totalitarian system to start off with, maybe then the more perfect technology you have, the greater the ability of the dictator to maintain himself In power using advanced surveillance technology or maybe like anti-aging technology, like whatever you can with perfect technology, maybe it becomes a knot that never goes away. And so in the ideal, if you want to end up with a kind of on the knot string, you might have to resolve some of these issues before you get technological maturity.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Progress, while celebrated, can lead to uncomfortable and counterintuitive outcomes that provoke unease about future possibilities. The pursuit of continuous improvement may yield a radically different human condition that challenges our values and perceptions. Analyzing what a 'solved world' entails‚Äîbeyond solving individual ailments, such as aging or disease‚Äîinvites reflection on the consequences of technological advancements, such as moving from traditional television to the integration of virtual reality and brain-computer interfaces. It emphasizes the importance of examining the long-term implications of our progress, even when such contemplation feels repulsive or daunting.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. So I don't really try to sell it but more drive dive right into that counterintuitive ness and awkwardness and almost the the sense of unease that comes if you really try to imagine what It would happen if we made all these little steps of Progress that everybody would agree are good individually and then you think through what that would actually produce then there Is a sense in which at least at first times a lot of sites, a lot of people would recoil from that. And so the book doesn't try to sugarcoat that, but like, let's really dive in and like think just how potentially repulsive and counterintuitive that condition of a solved world would Be, and not blink or look away and like stare straight into that and then like analyze what kinds of values could you actually have in this solved world. And I mean, I think I'm ultimately optimistic that as it were on the other side of that, there is something very worthwhile, but it certainly would be, I think, in many important ways, Very different from the current human condition. And there is a sort of paradox there that we're so busy making all these steps of progress that we celebrate as we make them, but we rarely look at where this ends up if things go well. And when we do, we kind of recoil. Like, that seems like, yeah, so I mean, you could cure the individual diseases and then you cure aging, but like also other little practical things, right? So you have, you know, you're black and white television, then you have a color television, then you have a remote control, you don't have to get up. Then you have a virtual reality headset, and then you have a little thing that reads your brain.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
A fulfilling life requires a balance between personal achievements and enjoyment. People may perceive a lack of fulfillment in those who do not apply themselves towards their potential, leading to judgments about the quality of their lives. However, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that for some individuals, like a recreational golf player, merely enjoying their activity can provide a sense of satisfaction and happiness, highlighting that fulfillment can come from different pursuits.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And so I guess one might say two things. One is some people perhaps would say that if that was all there was to a life, that there would be something missing from the life. Particularly if you're mad at a person who is like young enough and healthy and strong enough that they could have done something else with their life. And if we also mad and it's not a professional golf player who's actually up there who has that as their job. But it's just somebody who putters around a little bit once a while in the afternoon and that they don't do anything with their life. We might think that other things equal being like a less good life than somebody who apply themselves more. The other thing is that right now, maybe for the golf player, that is the only way that or maybe the best way that they can have enjoyment in their life. They enjoy playing golf and the striving gives them a kind of psychological satisfaction.</blockquote>

### [01:21:37] Navigating the Paradox of Infinite Value

### ‚ú® Summary
When applying aggregative consequentialism to scenarios involving infinite populations, one encounters the issue of undefined value due to the presence of infinite positive and negative outcomes. Even with finite probabilities, standard cardinal arithmetic fails to provide a clear result when subtracting infinite quantities. Alternative approaches, such as hyper reals, exist but introduce counterintuitive consequences that complicate the utility-maximizing framework. This complexity raises skepticism regarding the viability of aggregating individual values in an infinite context and questions the effectiveness of expected utility as a guiding principle in ethical decision-making.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So in particular problems from infinitarian paralysis, I wrote a paper on this quite a number of years ago now, which is if you take this kind of aggregative consequentialism framework Seriously, it looks like if you have a finite probability that the world is canonical infinite, has infinite many people and so on, then at least in standard cardinal arithmetic, it Looks like the value of the world, whatever you do, is going to be basically undefined. There's already infinitely much good stuff and infinitely much bad stuff, even if you weigh those by various probabilities, if the probabilities are sort of finite and positive, Still end up with these positive and negative infinite expected quantities and in standard cardinal arithmetic, subtraction of two infinite quantities is not defined. And so you can then try to sidestep that by introducing hyper reals or other frameworks, but they all come at various costs. There are various counterintuitive implications that you would have to accept. And I think thinking all of that through, it makes it a bit less appealing that all things considered this kind of expected utility maximizing framework, where the utility is an aggregate Of the value of the parts of the world, like different people. That actually all things considered a sensible thing. So that's me. Now I have in the past, I mean, indeed this concept of the cosmic endowment and in some of my other writings as well on existential risk. I have some of my work has taken the form of</blockquote>

### [23:03] Healthcare System Disincentivizes Long-Term Investment


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (21:31 - 23:01)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b077877d-df47-41f7-b93d-770f64b61963)


**Healthcare System Disincentivizes Long-Term Investment**

- The US healthcare system is structured in a way that discourages long-term cost savings.
- Insurance companies have short investment horizons (1-2 years) due to high churn.
- People frequently change insurance due to job changes, marriage, or relocation.
- This makes it difficult to invest in preventative care or treatments for chronic illnesses that pay off over longer periods (5-7 years).
-  No one is talking about changing this, although it would benefit everyone.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Ezekiel Emanuel</b><br/><br/>We've created a health care system where it's not in the system's interest to make those long term cost savings. What do you mean by that? You're talking about the incentives of the insurance companies? Say you're sitting at United or Humana or a Blue Cross and Blue Shield. You have a person, call them 30 years old, who you're insuring. You're going to spend money today for them, and the payoff's going to dribble out in five, six, seven years when they've gone for a long time with their diabetes under control or they've Gone for a long time ceasing to be obese. The problem is by the time those positive benefits come and the cost savings come, they're no longer being insured by you. We call this in the medical health policy world churn. The churn is so much in the insurance market that that investment horizon for companies is not five, six, seven years. It tends to be one year and maximum two years. Is that primarily because health insurance is tied to employment in this country? That's a large reason for it. People change jobs, lose jobs, move. They get married and they switch from their insurance to their spouse's insurance. We've created a system that perfectly disincentivizes long-term investments. And that's bad when chronic illness is the main source of costs. So we're going to have to change how we structure the insurance marketplace. And no one's talking about that at the moment.</blockquote>

**Affordable Care Act Outcomes**

- The Affordable Care Act has dramatically increased health insurance coverage, benefiting tens of millions.
- It has also helped stabilize healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP, remaining at 17.5%.
- While the ACA's impact on cost savings through increased insurance has been positive, its effect on quality of care has been inconsistent and somewhat disappointing.

Tens of millions of people have gotten insurance and gotten the benefits of health insurance, including less mortality, less stress, less anxiety.

**An Examined Life**

- Question the purpose of your life and how it relates to age.
- Recognize that people often claim to prioritize quality of life over quantity, yet act differently. 
- Reflect on what good you are doing in the world and whose lives you are improving. 
- Ensure you are consciously choosing and justifying how you are living. 
- Strive to live an "examined life," making deliberate and justified choices. 
- Consider what you are living for and whose lives you are making better.

<blockquote><b>Ezekiel Emanuel</b><br/><br/>I am not wild about that kind of life. You have to ask yourself, what is the purpose of my life? Why am I living? And how does that relate to age? Most people will say, if you just ask them, oh, I want quality over quantity, but then when they actually behave, they are taking quantity even when the quality of their life is not what They actually want. Of course, I think my view is the right view. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, but I will tell you, Stephen, it's a decade of people writing to me. About a third of people say, Dr. Emanuel, you're 100% right. A third of people say, well, you've made me rethink. They don't necessarily endorse my view. If I've just made you rethink how you're going to live your life and examine what you're living for, that's a really good thing. And, you know, a third of people think I'm off my rocker and maybe I am. It's quite a legacy, though, that you've made so many people rethink something as fundamental as the end of their life. I don't want to pat myself on the back, but I don't mind being what Socrates called the gadfly. Part of what I do as a professor is challenge people about their views, and I want them to rethink their views. They might embrace their views wholeheartedly. That's fine. As long as it's, as Socrates says, an examined life, as long as you can defend and justify where you've come down. That's the place people need to be. And I hope everyone gets there. I hope they think through, what am I living for? What good am I doing in this world? Whose lives am I making better? In the end, that's why we're here.</blockquote>

**Kryptow√§hrung und Politik**

- Joe Kaeser stellt sich ein hypothetisches Szenario vor, in dem der deutsche Bundeskanzler eine Kryptofirma kauft und einen Teil der nationalen Reserven in Kryptow√§hrungen investiert.
- Er betont, dass ein solches Vorgehen in Deutschland undenkbar w√§re und von den Medien scharf kritisiert w√ºrde.
- Im Gegensatz dazu verweist er auf die USA, wo solche Entwicklungen denkbar scheinen und die Grenzen zwischen Politik, Wirtschaft und Technologie verschwimmen.
- Kaeser verdeutlicht den Unterschied im Umgang mit Kryptow√§hrungen und der Rolle des Staates zwischen Deutschland und den USA.
- Er erw√§hnt die "vierte Gewalt", die Medien, und wie diese in Deutschland auf ein solches Szenario reagieren w√ºrden.

**Deutschlands Staatsreform**

- Deutschland braucht eine Staatsreform, initiiert von der Gesellschaft als vierter Gewalt.
- Ziel ist es, den Staat vom Vorgesetzten zum Dienstleister der B√ºrger zu machen.
- Die Wirtschaft muss als Mittelherkunft f√ºr alle direkten und indirekten Finanzierungen anerkannt werden.
- Es fehlt an Personen aus der Wirtschaft, die bereit sind, sich in der Politik zu engagieren und diese Ver√§nderungen voranzutreiben.

**Musiker als Seismographen**

- Musiker haben eine besondere Sensibilit√§t f√ºr Ver√§nderungen.
- Sie nehmen Eindr√ºcke wie ein Schwamm auf und verarbeiten sie in ihrem kreativen Prozess.
- Das Songwriting ist ein Ausdruck dieser aufgesaugten Erfahrungen.
- Klaus Meine betont, dass er nicht in die Zukunft schauen kann, aber die Sensibilit√§t von Musikern f√ºr Ver√§nderungen ist wichtig f√ºr die Kreativit√§t.

Und wenn man die Stunde schl√§gt, dann kommt all das zu Tage, was man sozusagen unterwegs mitgenommen hat. Diese Antennen, die man ausfahren muss, um der Kreativit√§t Nahrung zu geben. Das ist ein ganz wichtiger Prozess, aber auch ein normaler Prozess.

**Woodstock des Ostens**

- Klaus Meine beschreibt ein Konzert der Scorpions im Luschniki-Stadion in Moskau als 'Woodstock des Ostens'.
- √úber 100.000 Fans, darunter auch Soldaten, feierten friedlich zusammen und sangen die Lieder der Band mit.
- Die Soldaten warfen ihre Uniformteile in die Luft und feierten mit den Fans, anstatt f√ºr Ordnung zu sorgen.
- Dieses Ereignis wurde von Meine als ein Zeichen der Ver√§nderung und der Hoffnung auf eine friedlichere Zukunft interpretiert.
- Die Scorpions betonten bei einer Pressekonferenz den Unterschied zwischen ihrer Generation und der ihrer Eltern: 'Unsere Eltern sind mit Panzern gekommen, wir kommen mit Gitarren.'

<blockquote><b>Klaus Meine</b><br/><br/>Ja und ich glaube, das ist auch der Punkt, warum der Song so erfolgreich wurde, weil er eben nicht von den Bildern, die wir alle im Fernsehen gesehen haben, von Moorfall und so weiter Inspiriert war, sondern er war von der Zeit davor inspiriert und war eigentlich mehr ein Soundtrack von Glasnost und Perestroika. Und ich glaube, so hat das Gorbatschow auch empfunden, der uns ja wenige Tage vor seinem R√ºcktritt 1991 in den Kreml eingeladen hat, weil es dann auch eine russische Version davon im Song gab. Und ich glaube, es ist so spannend, weil es eben die Zeit davor auf den Punkt ausgedr√ºckt hat. Und das, was wir empfunden haben, war einfach, die Welt ver√§ndert sich vor unseren Augen. Dieses Luschniki-Stadion mit √ºber 100.000 Fans, die unsere Lieder gesungen haben, wo so eine gro√üe Begeisterung f√ºr westliche Rockmusik, f√ºr westliche Kultur r√ºberkam von so vielen Fans, die aus Sibirien und √ºberall gekommen waren, aber auch aus der damaligen DDR. Auch Soldaten haben mitgesungen und mitgefeiert. Die Soldaten haben mitgefeiert, die standen vor der B√ºhne und es gab ja richtig hunderte von Soldaten, die als Security eingesetzt waren. Aber es blieb alles friedlich und die Soldaten haben ihre Jacketts ausgezogen, ihre Caps in die Luft geworfen, haben sich umgedreht und haben zusammen mit den Fans dieses Rock'n Fest Und wie sp√§ter genannt wurde, dieses Woodstock des Ostens mitgefeiert.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gabor Steingart</b><br/><br/>Das war ja in gewisser Weise die Implosion der Sowjetunion vorweggenommen, dass die Ordnungsmacht nicht mehr Ordnung machen wollte, sondern eigentlich sich vereinen wollte.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Epigenetics explains cellular diversity, allowing identical genomes to produce different cell types through selective gene activation.
2. Some gene activation patterns in epigenetics may be inherited across generations, influencing future offspring.
3. Humans are biologically vulnerable and reliant on culture for survival, differentiating them from other species that can thrive independently.
4. Cultural tools, social structures, and knowledge transfer are essential for human survival in natural settings, emphasizing our dependency on cultural development.
5. Manipulation of genomes through artificial selection in plants and animals raises ethical concerns when considering similar practices in humans.
6. Historical examples of human genetic manipulation highlight the risks associated with selection influenced by totalitarian ideologies, necessitating caution in genetic experimentation.

### [11:43] Understand Epigenetics: The Key to Cellular Diversity


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (10:24 - 11:47)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c7d1b9a-ebda-43fc-b86a-472a14483263)




### ‚ú® Summary
Epigenetics explains how all cells in a body contain the same genome yet develop into different types such as liver, kidney, and muscle cells. This variation arises from the selective activation of different genes in specific cell types. Recent research suggests that some of these gene activation patterns may be inherited by the next generation, highlighting the potential for epigenetics to transcend individual development and influence future offspring.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, you actually have a very seditious sentence at some point early in the book, which I think you say is something like, forgive me for putting dangerous words into your mouth. Yes, I know the one you mean. But they were dangerous on the page. He said something like the best machine for translating a genotype into a phenotype that we know of is a woman or something like that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, that's right. I could have said any female. Yes, right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, perhaps we'll return to that combustible topic. Yes. So what is meant by the word epigenetics and where does that concept come into play here?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>EPIgenetics is I think a much misused word. It's really just a word for embryology. The thing is that every cell in your body, every cell in our bodies has the same genome, the same diploid set of genes, and yet the cells are all different. So liver cells are different from kidney cells, different from muscle cells, and so on. And the reason is epigenetics. The reason is that some genes are turned on in liver cells and different genes are turned on in kidney cells, different genes are turned on in nerve cells, and so on. That's epigenetics. Now there has very recently been a suggestion that some of these turning on, turnings on, of genes can get passed on to the next generation.</blockquote>

### [26:17] Naked Apes: Survival Depends on Culture

### ‚ú® Summary
Human beings are inherently ill-equipped for survival in nature compared to other species, as their physical attributes do not support their existence without cultural tools and social structures. This vulnerability highlights a stark difference between humans and other organisms, emphasizing that, unlike most living beings, humans require cultural development such as shelter, clothing, and knowledge transfer to navigate their environment effectively. Absent these elements, an individual human's chances of survival in a raw natural setting are extremely limited, often facing death within days due to exposure and lack of survival skills.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What do you make of the fact that human beings seem so imperfectly selected to survive without material culture. Actually, David Deutsch, who I know you know, at least by reputation, if not personally, over there in Oxford, a very smart man, he's made the point that the Earth already is essentially A spaceship for us. So if you just leave him out exposed even to an object, night without the benefit of shelter or clothing or fire or, you know, he's, you know, for at least many nights of the year, he's likely To die of hypothermia, right? So it's like we're just not... We're these naked apes that are not great at survival apart from being in tribal bands who have produced a modicum of material culture and an ability to pass on that culture to subsequent Generations. But in and of themselves, each representative of the species, devoid of culture, put on a desert island, is liable to die over the course of 72 hours or a week because of just being fundamentally Unable to survive one slammed up against raw nature. What do you make of the difference between human beings and basically everything else we see in the living world.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The manipulation of genomes, particularly in domestic animals and plants, has been achieved through thousands of years of artificial selection, resulting in significant changes from their wild ancestors. While successful in altering animal and plant genetics, the concept of applying similar selective breeding to humans raises profound ethical concerns. Historical attempts at human genetic manipulation, such as those by the Nazis, serve as warnings against the potential dangers of selection driven by totalitarian ideologies. If such practices were to continue or escalate in the future, they could lead to unspeakable consequences, creating variations of humans akin to the breeds of domesticated animals, exposing the crucial need for caution and responsibility in genetic experimentation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Changes within our own genomes. If you had a time machine and you could glimpse what we're up to on that front, 50 years from now or 100 years from now, what would you expect?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We've been changing the genomes of domestic animals and plants for thousands of years, really, really radically. And so the sort of domestic animals that we keep, like and horses and pigs, chickens, and pets like dogs, are incredibly different from their wild ancestors. And that's been achieved not by manipulation of the genes directly, but by artificial selection. So if you think that a Pekingese and a Chihuahua are actually genetically wolves that have been modified by differential selection by humans. You're now asking the question about the other part of the Darwinian equation, which is mutation. We've shown we can modify animals by selection. We've never done that with humans, and the Nazis tried, and thank goodness they didn't succeed. But you could have bred, one could imagine that in thousands of years' time, if totalitarian regimes started selecting humans the way we've selected dogs and cabbages, you could produce All sorts of monstrous humans analogous to producing chihuahuas from wolves. And... Yeah, but obviously you could do it much more quickly. Yes, it's much quicker. But you don't know what you're doing.</blockquote>

**Ampel-Koalition und Handlungsunf√§higkeit**

- Marco Buschmann argumentiert, dass die Ampel-Koalition handlungsunf√§hig geworden war und Schaden im Land anrichtete.
- Sie habe sich der dramatischen Lage verweigert und keine ad√§quaten Antworten formuliert.
- Wenn eine Regierung nicht in der Lage ist, die Probleme zu erkennen und zu l√∂sen, sei es richtig, die Zusammenarbeit zu beenden.
- Die FDP wollte inhaltliche √Ñnderungen, die die Partner nicht mittragen wollten.

**Korrektur des Kurses der Linken**

- Dietmar Bartsch r√§umt ein, dass die Linkspartei ein Problem mit der Identit√§tspolitik hatte, wie von Fabio De Masi kritisiert.
- Er betont, dass die Partei diesen Kurs bereits korrigiert hat.
- Bartsch, Gysi und Ramelow setzen sich f√ºr einen neuen Ansatz ein, der die Interessen Ostdeutschlands sowie von Stadt und Land gleicherma√üen ber√ºcksichtigt.
-  Die Linke versteht sich nicht ausschlie√ülich als ostdeutsche Partei, sondern will ein breiteres Angebot f√ºr alle W√§hler schaffen.

<blockquote><b>Ian Bremmer</b><br/><br/>And every provincial government is bankrupt. And real estate is in crisis. That is 70 percent of Chinese consumer wealth and about 30% of Chinese government revenue. And they're not going to come close to their 5% growth target this year. This is a new Chinese economic leadership put in place by Xi Jinping. They are suddenly telling the president, we're not going to be able to perform like we told you we were not a good place to be on your first year. And that's also the 75th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. So there was a lot of panic going on among the top economists a couple of weeks ago in China. And that's why they're all trying to run around and say, what do we do? What kind of stimulus do we put in place? It was it was it's the same kind of transition that we saw when they went from zero covid to suddenly overnight.</blockquote>

Now, I mean, if this was happening in any normal country around the world and by normal, I mean a country that you get reporting out of, information out of. It's all we'd be talking about. But because it's China and because very few people go to China right now, I mean, there just is nowhere near the level of travel that you saw pre-COVID. And because the Chinese don't actually report on any of this stuff, we're not really talking about it. And I think that's a really big deal.</blockquote>

**Lars Felds Empfehlungen f√ºr die deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik**

- Deutschland braucht eine Umkehr in der Arbeitsmarktregulierung und Reformen im Sozialbereich, um die Sozialbelastungen und Lohnzusatzkosten zu senken.
- G√ºnstigere Energie ist notwendig, ebenso eine Steuerreform zur Entlastung der Unternehmen.
- Eine massive Deregulierung in verschiedenen Bereichen ist unerl√§sslich.

<blockquote><b>Lars Feld</b><br/><br/>Und Sozialpolitik, hier muss man insbesondere bei der Arbeitsmarktregulierung umkehren. Nicht nur nichts mehr draufsetzen, wie kein Tariftreuegesetz oder so, sondern umkehren. Man muss im Sozialbereich so reformieren, dass die Sozialbelastungen und die Lohnzusatzkosten nicht weiter nach oben gehen. Wir ben√∂tigen g√ºnstigere Energie. Auch dazu gibt es eine Reihe von Ans√§tzen, auch wenn das schwierig ist, aber es ist schon was machbar. Wir brauchen eine Steuerreform, also eine Entlastung der Unternehmen bei der Unternehmensbesteuerung. Und wir brauchen eine massive Deregulierung in ganz unterschiedlichen Bereichen, nicht nur im Arbeitsrecht.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Dagmar Rosenfeld</b><br/><br/>Und dazu jetzt direkt die Anschlussfrage, bevor Sie, Herr Haukab, gleich loslegen k√∂nnen. Was w√ºrden die einzelnen Parteien und denkbare Koalitionen denn dagegen setzen?</blockquote>

**Reasons for Trump's success**

- Trump ran a flawless campaign and successfully used podcasts and earned media. 
- Voters disliked the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, and were concerned about the economy.

**Democratic Party Accountability**

- The Democratic Party's loss isn't solely on Kamala Harris; the entire party supported the agenda that led to this outcome.
- From economic policies to open borders and soft-on-crime approaches, their platform alienated voters even in traditionally blue states.

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>Remember, not only did they pass trillions in spending, they wanted four and a half trillion more for Build Back Better. And the only reason that didn't happen is because Manchin and Sinema voted against it. Can you imagine how much worse inflation would have been? Manchin was driven into retirement and Sinema was basically kicked out of the party. She effectively told us that at the All In Summit. So this defeat is on the entire Democratic Party. The Democratic Party was in support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's agenda. They were in support of the de facto open border policies. They were in support of the soft on crime Soros DA decarceral policies. You can see that even in California, which is a deep blue state, there's a huge backlash. Huge. This sort of insane, soft on crime agenda the Democrats have. 70% of California voted for Prop 36, which basically reversed the excesses of Prop 47, which a decade ago basically made shoplifting legal in California. You know who opposed Prop 36 despite its massive popularity? Gavin Newsom. Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she supported it or not. So what you see is that even in blue states, the Democratic Party elites are completely out of touch with what people want. And then finally, you've got foreign policy, where I think that the Democratic agenda, basically wanting to engage in a proxy war with Vladimir Putin because he's the incarnation Of all evil. That, I think, has blown up in the collective West face. That has been a</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. The recent Fed rate cuts of 50 basis points serve as both an economic tailwind and a potential warning signal, indicating a complex economic landscape ahead.
2. AI is set to disrupt customer support by initially handling basic queries and escalating more complex issues, taking advantage of existing tiered structures.
3. The accuracy of advanced AI models is improving, suggesting they can be effectively utilized in customer support, particularly in scenarios where precision is less critical.
4. Rural internet and EV charging station initiatives have led to a significant $50 billion waste by the US government, raising concerns about allocation and efficiency.
5. The venture capital sector reflects on challenging years, questioning whether the traditional model is broken and how to adapt to changing market conditions.
6. The first Trump/Kamala debate reveals key factors that could influence each candidate's chances of winning or losing the upcoming race.
7. As customer support leverages AI, there is a risk of commoditization due to the accessibility of data for training models, emphasizing the need for innovation in more regulated sectors to maintain a competitive edge.

### [21:21] Customer Support: The Gateway to AI Disruption


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (19:40 - 21:21)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/abba54aa-a27b-4b28-b4fe-181866566897)




### ‚ú® Summary
Sales is poised to experience significant disruption following customer support, largely due to the variances in tolerable error rates across industries. While legal services cannot afford mistakes due to their high stakes, customer support can leverage AI, starting from basic queries at level one and gradually moving to more complex issues. The existing tiered structure in customer support allows for effective integration of large language models (LLMs), as they can take on initial inquiries and escalate them as necessary. The improving accuracy of AI models, particularly those with advanced reasoning capabilities, suggests a readiness for adoption in environments where precision is less critical, indicating a transformative impact on many jobs in the sector.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, I think sales will be the one that's disrupted after customer support. I don't know. I think it's gonna be very disruptive. One of the reasons I think this is, you know, in the early days of LLMs, people were saying that legal services would be disrupted. And you saw some very highly valued startups rocketing up based on that. I think the problem with that is the error rate. So when you think about AI applications, you have to think about what is the tolerable error rate that the industry will allow. Because we know that AIs get things wrong, they can hallucinate, and you're never gonna be able to make it perfect. I mean, you can improve the quality, but it's still gonna have some errors. And when you're dealing with like legal services, for example, you just can't have mistakes. This is not tolerated. However, customer support is different. Customer support is already organized into levels, level one, level two, level three, based on difficulty. And there's already, in a sense, a mechanism for failover. If the level one customer support person can't answer the question, they kick it up to level two. So there's a place for LLMs to start in Customer Support, which is replacing all the level one and then working their way up the chain to level two as they get better and better. And so what I'm saying is that the level of accuracy now, especially with the new PhD level reasoning models is good enough. Yeah. We don't need to wait for like some perfect LLM model. And I think this is why this is going to be a big, big disruption. Let me tell you this. Millions of people potentially are going to have their jobs disrupted or at least transformed.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, it could be the end of the entire career as well, Chamath, if you were to look at this four by four</blockquote>

### [27:39] In the race to innovate in AI, beware the fleeting value of commoditized solutions.


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (25:26 - 27:28)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6abd38c8-8e9f-46fb-b015-c9b525af3163)




### ‚ú® Summary
Customer support represents a promising use case for AI due to the abundance of accessible data such as product documentation and recorded support interactions. This data can effectively train AI models, making it less sensitive compared to proprietary information like medical or legal records. Despite the potential for rapid advancements in foundation models, which may lead to high valuations for startups pursuing customer support innovations, the ease of accessibility and implementation of these models poses a significant risk of commoditization. This trend could permit smaller teams to leverage next-generation models quickly, undermining the sustainability of the business value created by current customer support solutions. Focusing on more regulated sectors that require specialized customization is essential, as these areas have a lower tolerance for error and present higher barriers to entry, fostering a competitive advantage that is less likely to be commoditized.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One of the reasons why I'm bullish on this customer support use case is because there's a very large data set to train on You've got all of the product documentation that companies very Created. You've got all the previous email Support, you know, so and calls. Yeah, the calls have been recorded so you can now train the AI on that So there's a very large body of data to train the AI model on. And it's not necessarily the most proprietary. It's not like dealing with people's medical records or even confidential legal documents, something like that. So the data is readily available. And then the foundation models are getting really good. I think there's a big question here about value capture, which is there's a number of startups now that are becoming very highly valued, that are chasing this disruption, this sort Of customer support agent disruption, and they're getting into very high valuations, even unicorn valuations already. And the question is, well, wait, if the foundation models are advancing at such a rate, like a year from now, why couldn't it like a developer, just a startup of a few guys take next year's Model, train it and then commoditize the.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Trying to figure out what applications we would build, and which sectors of the economy we would go after. I was like, guys, we gotta go after the hardest, most regulated places. Because those are the things and places and people that have absolutely zero tolerance for error and where you're going to need to do some amount of customization and specialization Actually solve these problems. And it sacks to your point, like when you see, and I said, we cannot touch customer service, we cannot touch it because it's going to get commoditized and run over by these foundational Models within a year. Right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I mean, it's just too easy.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You'll be able to deploy these. It's just too easy. You'll be able to do it on a local computer. I mean, you'll just download the entire database and a recall on a MacBook with an M3.</blockquote>

### [31:36] Quantum Computing Threat to Encryption


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (30:29 - 32:11)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/224382a6-580b-43a5-9ffd-a09560ce885a)


**Quantum Computing Threat to Encryption**

- Quantum computers using Shor's algorithm could factor large numbers quickly, potentially breaking current encryption standards.
- These standards, crucial for Bitcoin, browsers, and servers, rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers with traditional computers.
- A large-scale quantum computer could crack these codes in seconds or minutes, potentially jeopardizing global security.
- Although the exact timeline is uncertain, this threat may be just a few years away.
- Post-quantum encryption standards are being developed in anticipation of this threat.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>This is a big area of opportunity. One of the very interesting areas that a lot of people are talking about is in cryptography. So there's an algorithm by a professor who was at MIT for many years named Shore. It's called Shore's algorithm. And in 1994, 1995, I think, around that time, he basically came up with this idea that you could use a quantum computer to factor numbers almost instantly. And all modern encryption standards, so all of the RSA standards, everything that Bitcoin's blockchain is built on, all of our browsers, all server technology, all computer security Technology is built on algorithms that are based on number factorization. So if you can factor a very large number, a number that's 256 digits long, theoretically, you could break a code. And it's really impossible to do that with traditional computers at the scale that we operate our encryption standards at today. But a quantum computer can do it in seconds or minutes. And that's based on Shor's algorithm. And if you want, there's some great YouTube videos that describe Shor's algorithm and how it works. But it's like, mind blowing when you look at it, it's like, this really like non intuitive, but simple set of steps that when you put them together on a quantum computer, it's like, this Thing can instantly figure out all the factors and then you can break a code. One of the things that this highlights is that in a couple of years, theoretically, if Google continues on this track and now they build a large scale qubit computer, they theoretically Would be in a position to start to run some of these quantum algorithms like Shorts algorithm. And so we're now kind of spitting distance or a couple of years, it's not really clear is it three years, five years, seven years, but a couple of years away from having computers that Theoretically could crack all encryption standards. And there are a set of encryption standards that are called post-quantum encryption.</blockquote>

### [52:07] Apple's Lack of Taste and Data

**Apple's Lack of Taste and Data**

- Apple's decline in user experience is due to a lack of 'taste' and an aversion to using data.
- While 'taste' is a valuable asset, it's rare, and most tech companies rely on data to inform product decisions.
- Apple, however, lacks both, leading to a suboptimal user experience, as there's no system in place to catch and correct issues.

<blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Keith Rabois</b><br/><br/>Let me, let me pause, double click on that for a second. So I think taste is great if you have it, but there's only so many people on the planet that are going to have, you know, cutting edge taste and be right. If you don't have taste, what most tech companies do is they use data. Data is something that's approachable and leverageable. Because Apple has the antibodies to using data to measure success with the user experience, measure whatever success. If you subtract taste even by a bit, you don't have the scaffolding that every other company would use. And so you see the worst of both worlds.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jason Calacanis</b><br/><br/>That's a great take. That's a great take. I mean, you just go off</blockquote>

**How to Deal with TikTok**

- If you were president, determine TikTok's fair market value.
- Find buyers willing to pay that price.
- If the CCP refuses to sell at that price, it confirms they view TikTok as a strategic tool, not just a business.

1. Undocumented workers contribute significantly to the caregiving sector by taking on essential but undervalued jobs.
2. The presence of undocumented workers alleviates labor shortages and helps maintain affordable care for families.
3. These workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and lack basic protections due to their undocumented status.
4. Punitive measures against undocumented immigrants, such as mass deportations, could harm society and undermine community compassion.
5. The potential consequences of demonizing undocumented workers may mirror the negative economic impacts seen in situations like Brexit.

### [15:46] Value Undocumented Workers Bring to Society

### ‚ú® Summary
Undocumented workers play a crucial role in filling essential positions in the caregiving sector, particularly in jobs that are otherwise unattractive due to low pay and high demands. Their presence not only addresses labor shortages but also helps in maintaining affordability for families. Despite their vital contributions, these workers face heightened risks of exploitation and lack essential protections due to their status. Measures aimed at punishing or demonizing these immigrants, such as mass deportations, would cause significant harm to society, diminish compassion within communities, and could lead to a detrimental cycle akin to self-inflicted economic harm, echoing the consequences seen in events like Brexit.

Their contributions are significant, but their undocumented status can also lead them lacking access to many worker protections and vulnerable to exploitation. A knee-jerk reaction taken from the fascist handbook of demonizing immigrants, like mass deportations, detention camps, would have a devastating effect on the U.S. It would be inflationary and reduce the compassion millions of undocumented workers bestow on our children and the elderly. Punishing immigrants could be the U.S. Version Brexit, a self-inflicted injury. There is a cartoon of an undocumented worker criminalizing his way across the nation, carrying a backpack of fentanyl, stopping to dine on your Cocker Spaniel.

**BMW Purchase**

- As a 23-year-old at Morgan Stanley, Scott Galloway bought a used, navy blue BMW 325i for $28,000, exceeding his $25,000 bonus.
- He views this as a "smart signaling purchase," aimed at attracting potential partners by displaying financial stability.
- He later sold the car to fund a European trip, minimizing his loss and ultimately finding the purchase worthwhile.

<blockquote><b>Ed Elson</b><br/><br/>Oh, yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>And I think I told you, I think I bought a 325i Navy Blue. I bought it out of the recycler. I think I spent, I forget what it was. My first bonus was like 25 grand. I spent 28 grand on a car. But I think of that, I mean, this sounds dumb, but a bad car that you don't need in college and high school, I kind of needed it, but I just couldn't afford it. You know, that's a dumb purchase. I would argue that when you're 23, working at Morgan Stanley, and you're in your mating years, that buying a BMW and hanging swim goggles from the rearview mirror, that makes a lot of Sense. You're trying to say, you're trying to signal to women that if you have kids with me, your kids are more likely to survive than if you date someone who is driving a Hyundai and does water Aerobics. So I sort of, I empathize with what I'll call smart signaling purchases. I think it's difficult to lecture someone your age on to not occasionally buy cool shit and do cool things. Your 20s come and go. You want to signal attractiveness. I get sort of the irrational purchases. To me, the BMW kind of made sense. And also I sold it and it paid for my European trip. So it was worth it. And I don't think I lost that much value on it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Ed Elson</b><br/><br/>Yeah.

<blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>Also, something I did once I had kids was, and what I would recommend is ask yourself, can you make a lifestyle arbitrage? And this was my partner's idea. She said, let's move to Florida. We're going to be able to cut our rent in half, if not by 60%. We're going to cut our private school tuition for our two boys by two-thirds. Grace Church wanted $58,000 a year and for me to bring that lady muffins. And then they ask you, are you philanthropic? Like, are you going to give us more money? Anyways, so we immediately cut our burn and that was her idea. And she was smart. She's like, no, we're going to love Florida. It's nice. Stop being such a snob. I'm like, I'm not going to Florida. They're all yeehaws down there driving F-150s and shooting at each other and their guns and everything.

All those better things life. But what I did do was smart. I took all of the money that we saved and I put it into the market. And so immediately, I think combined, we were probably making, you know, I was probably making between, I don't know, $400,000 and $700,000 a year between the two of us. And then we took that 14% swing in savings and all the other savings. We took about $150,000, $200,000 a year and we put it into stocks for 10 years from 2010 to 2020. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Ed Elson</b><br/><br/>I mean, the thing that really shocks me is that, I mean, just how crazy it's gotten $400,000 to $700,000 a year and you got priced out of New York.

> To understand the 2024 election results, it helps to go back to 2020. Donald Trump lost the election that year, but he made significant gains with nonwhite voters. At the time, a lot of Democrats saw that as a fluke, a hangover from Covid lockdown policies. But the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini saw it as bellwether.<br/>>  In his 2023 book, ‚Äú Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP ,‚Äù Ruffini argued that Trump was ushering in a party realignment. A trend that had been happening for years in the white electorate ‚Äì college-educated voters moving to the left, and non-college-educated ones moving to the right ‚Äì was now evident, he said, among voters of all races, breaking up the core of the Democratic base.<br/>>  And so far, the data we have from this election suggests that Ruffini was right.<br/>>  In this conversation, Ruffini, a founding partner at Echelon Insights, contextualizes the 2024 election results by looking back at 2020‚Äôs. We discuss what Democrats missed about these voter trends; the appeal of Trump‚Äôs brand of class politics; why Democrats might have been better off with a red wave in the 2022 midterms; and how Kamala Harris‚Äôs campaign may have hurt her with nonwhite working-class voters.<br/>>  Book Recommendations:<br/>>   Steadfast Democrats  by Ismail K.

**Social Pressure & Political Shifts**

- Shifts in group identity can be influenced by social pressure and a cascade effect.
- As individuals within a group start to change their political affiliations, it can create a tipping point where others feel more comfortable doing the same.

<blockquote><b>Patrick Ruffini</b><br/><br/>Sort of rhetoric? There is not necessarily a sea change in economic condition, but there's a social component to this as well. It's sort of a cascade effect, right? When you have groups that have this, just this solid democratic group identity that is reinforced by political machines, and then it just seems like there's a tipping point at some Point where gradually people are moving, and then enough people move to where people kind of start looking around and saying, well, maybe I'm not alone. Maybe I can be more vocal about this. And you really saw that in 2020. You saw demonstrations of pro-Trump activity in a lot of these places where people would have been ostracized for saying they supported a Republican. And so I think it's more gradual shifts elsewhere. But if you look specifically at why the Rio Grande Valley has shifted so far so fast, I think it's part of this, the social pressure around the Democratic Party breaking down. And I think I would analogize that to some extent to what has actually happened in the Black community. And there's a great book, I was probably going to call it out at the end with your three books, a segment, called Steadfast Democrats by Ismael White and Cheryl Laird, which really talks About the ways in which we would have expected Black voters to move more away from the Democratic Party based on changes and sort of their ideological beliefs based on changes in their Views of different policy issues over the years. But the reason we haven't is because there is a very solid Democratic voting norm that's enforced by being in the Black community, by attending the Black church and whatnot, that has Slowly attenuated over the years as you have fewer people going to Black churches, as you have more suburbanization, people moving out of predominantly Black communities, but it's Still very strong. So the idea is I think some form of that had happened in a place like the Rio Grande Valley in 2020.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Ezra Klein</b><br/><br/>Obviously, one thing that can explain this changing</blockquote>

There's a problem described, obviously, by David Shore in terms of talking about the capture, really, of the Democratic Party by its elite professional class. Harris had massive rallies, right, in the campaign. But it turns out those were the same people who were coming out for Hillary, and that was not a winning coalition. There's obviously a lot of enthusiasm right behind campaigning on these very highly emotionally charged issues, but they're primarily issues that are important to the minority Of voters who have college diplomas, and particularly to the 31 to 32 percent of the electorate who are white voters with college degrees.

**Democrats' Misguided Outreach**

- The Democrats' focus on endorsements from figures like Liz Cheney, while seemingly demonstrating a broad coalition, misses the mark. 
-  Their outreach should target cultural environments where they've become distant, such as the audiences of Joe Rogan or sports talk radio.

<blockquote><b>Ezra Klein</b><br/><br/>It just speaks to a lack of accountability in American politics. At the same time, though, it also struck me as maybe getting what the divide in the country is wrong, right? The message of that was supposed to be, look how wide this coalition stretches, right? It's all the way from Liz Cheney on one side to Liz Warren on the other. But that's not the divide, right? The sort of red-blue divide of Obama's 2004 speech isn't the divide. It's more this educational divide. And so in a way, it would have been much more, and I've been a little bit of a broken record on this all season, it would have been much more relevant to the divide that Harris and the Democrats Actually face for Harris to have gone on Joe Rogan and Theo Vaughn and shows like that that are much more cultural environments that Democrats have become increasingly distant from Than to be campaigning arm-in with Liz Cheney in defense of democracy. It's like a crazy way to think about how the system has changed, that Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney are in some ways, and Mitt Romney, are more on the same side, closer together, more arm-in Than Kamala Harris and Sports Talk Radio and Joe Rogan. But that feels true. I'm curious what you made of that moment and also what you make of this idea that Democrats are sort of pretending to reach out here, right? They're not reaching out in the places that they're uncomfortable. It's just that in a wild way, the places and people they're comfortable with have really changed over the past 20 years.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Patrick Ruffini</b><br/><br/>I think that,</blockquote>

**Faster Revenue Growth for Startups**

- The time to reach $100 million in annual revenue is decreasing for startups.
- YC batches are experiencing 3x growth during the program, driven by strong enterprise adoption of their products.
- Vertical AI is further accelerating this trend.
- The number of companies reaching $100 million ARR annually has increased tenfold each decade over the past 20 years.
- Concerns about LLM reliability hindering enterprise adoption have diminished as businesses prioritize strong ROI.

<blockquote><b>Garry Tan</b><br/><br/>The general thing that is true is that the time it's taking to reach $100 million in annual revenue is trending down.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jared Friedman</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and not only that, we had dinner with Ben Horowitz recently. And remember he was saying when they started Andreessen Horowitz, the common understanding was that in any given year, there'd only be 15 companies that year that would even make it To $100 million a year revenue. They said they ran the numbers the last 20 years and every decade, the number of companies that could actually make it to $100 million went up by 10x. So what was 15 per year, maybe 20 years ago, I mean, we're talking about 1500 companies a year that have a real shot at actually making that number. And when you combine that with what we're seeing in the summer and fall batches it's not that surprising and jared had a really good argument on our last episode about how vertical ai</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Diana Hu</b><br/><br/>Is gonna enable this to have thousand five hundred plus companies to bloom yeah that's why it's growing so fast it's because the value prop to companies of these products is so incredibly Strong that like they're just flying off the shelves because like companies are smart and they can do an roi calculation and when the roi is fantastic all these all these truisms that People believe about enterprise sales cycles and like how to taste to get big enterprise deals go out the window because companies are smart and they'll make rational decisions. You know, Harj, there's another way that this broke in favor of startups that I was thinking about. It's hard to even remember now, but a year ago, one of the things that people said a lot was that these LLMs are not reliable enough to deploy in the enterprise. They hallucinate.</blockquote>

### [26:40] Code Editing: A Path to Efficiency


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (25:20 - 26:45)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2b56b219-84f9-49d0-a70e-78a3cff21d78)




### ‚ú® Summary
The goal of developing a code editing model is to enhance user efficiency by allowing the model to intuitively suggest and navigate edits. This involves creating a responsive system that understands the context of changes and seamlessly guides users through their code. By enabling users to jump to specific lines automatically, the model minimizes unnecessary manual navigation, thereby improving the editing experience. The efficient design pushes for a system that requires users to press a minimal number of keys, promoting a workflow where the model anticipates the user's needs and continually provides relevant edits without unnecessary interruptions.

<blockquote><b>Michael Truell</b><br/><br/>One of the things we really wanted was we wanted the model to be able to edit code for us. That was kind of a wish. And we had multiple attempts at it before we had a sort of a good model that could edit code for you. Then after we had a good model, I think there have been a lot of effort to make the inference fast for having a good experience. And we've been starting to incorporate, I mean, Michael sort of mentioned this, like ability to jump to different places. And that jump to different places, I think, came from a feeling of, you know, once you accept an edit, it's like, man, it should be just really obvious where to go next. It's like, I'd made this change. The model should just know that like the next place to go to is 18 lines down. If you're a Wim user, you could press 1, 8, JJ or whatever. But why am I doing this? The model should just know it. And then so the idea was, you just press tab, it would go 18 lines down, and then show you the next edit, and you would press tab. So it was just as long as you could keep pressing tab. And so the internal competition was how many tabs can we make someone press? Once you have the idea, more sort of abstractly, the thing to think about is how are the edits sort of zero entropy?</blockquote>

### [55:03] Embrace Dynamic Design for Flexibility

### ‚ú® Summary
Effective web design requires adapting to variable input sizes while maintaining clarity and functionality. The use of a declarative approach, such as React with JSX, allows designers to specify priorities and relationships of elements on the page. This method leverages a rendering engine to dynamically fit and present content. As design needs evolve, this approach not only accommodates changes in context but also facilitates debugging by separating data inputs from rendered outputs, allowing for easier adjustments and improvements.

<blockquote><b>Arvid Lunnemark</b><br/><br/>Dynamic information, which you don't have, for example, if you're making, like designing a print magazine, you have like, you know exactly where you can put stuff. But when you have a website, or when you have a prompt, you have these inputs and then you need to format them to always work. Even if the input is really big, then you might have to cut something down. And so the idea was, okay, like, let's take some inspiration. What's the best way to design websites? Well, the thing that we really like is React and the declarative approach where you use JSX in JavaScript, and then you declare, this is what I want, and I think this has higher priority, Or this has higher Z index than something else. And then you have this rendering engine in web design. It's like Chrome, and in our case, it's a preempt renderer, which then fits everything onto the page. And as you declare it, it will decide what you want, and then it figures out what you want. And so we have found that to be quite helpful. And I think the role of it has sort of shifted over time, where initially it was to fit to these small context windows. Now it's really useful because, you know, it helps us with splitting up the data that goes into the prompt and the actual rendering of it. And so it's easier to debug because you can change the rendering of the prompt and then try it on old prompts because you have the raw data that went into the prompt.</blockquote>

### [03:48] Beware the Narrative: Truth Often Lies Beneath

### ‚ú® Summary
Media narratives can distort reality by glamorizing figures like Nasrallah, presenting them as charismatic leaders while downplaying their violent actions and the consequences of their policies. The coverage often omits significant facts, such as the role of Hezbollah in the massacre of innocents, reflecting an editorial bias that assumes readers lack concern for Muslim casualties. This ethical dilemma illustrates the need for critical engagement with information, recognizing the potential for manipulation in mainstream narratives.

Needless to say, there was almost no mention of the fact that Nasrallah and Hezbollah helped Bashar al-Assad kill hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Syria. The editors over the New York Times and The Guardian and the BBC seem to think that their readers don't care much about these Muslim deaths, and they're probably right. Reading this coverage, you're likely to form the impression that Nasrallah himself was quite a grandfatherly figure with a winning smile. He is described as charismatic and revered and as a great organizer and an astute strategist and pragmatic and idolized by his followers. The New York Times, in their obituary, makes it seem like he was a man of peace committed to a two-state solution, when in fact he was a religious lunatic running one of the world's most Lethal terrorist organizations, and he had an immense amount of innocent blood on his hands.

### [13:54] Truth Demands Effort; Fiction Rewards Ease

### ‚ú® Summary
Creating a truthful account requires substantial investment in time, effort, and resources, including rigorous fact-checking and evidence gathering. Historical accuracy necessitates extensive education, often spanning a decade, involving mastery of languages and interpretive skills. Documents from the past may contain biases, and the challenge of discerning factual accuracy from propaganda complicates the pursuit of truth. Conversely, fiction requires minimal effort, allowing writers to easily fabricate narratives, which is appealing in a world that often favors simplicity over complexity. This highlights an inherent imbalance between truth and fiction, with fiction thriving in a frictionless space where depth and accuracy are often sacrificed for ease of understanding.

<blockquote><b>Yuval Noah Harari</b><br/><br/>If you want to write or to produce a truthful account of something, of the Roman Empire, of the economic crisis, whatever, you need to invest a lot of time and effort and money in looking For evidence and fact-checking and analyzing. Like, I don't know, if you want to know something that happened in the Roman Empire. So, you know, historians, they go to university to study for at least 10 years before they become professional historians. You learn Latin and Greek and how to read ancient handwriting and how to do these archaeological excavations. And even if you found a document from the Roman Empire and you know Latin and you can read it, maybe it's just propaganda. Just because Caesar says that the enemy had 100,000 soldiers, it doesn't mean they actually had 100,000 soldiers. So how do you evaluate information? So the truth is very costly. Fiction, on the other hand, is very cheap. You just write the first thing that comes to your mind. The truth is also very complicated, or often it's complicated because reality is complicated. Whereas fiction can make it as simple as you would like it to be. And people tend to prefer, in most cases, simplicity over complexity.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>So this is another disadvantage. So you're pointing out there an asymmetrical relationship between truth and fiction. Absolutely. Which redounds to the advantage of fiction in this friction-free environment.</blockquote>

### [26:45] Mythology Guides Power, Not Facts

### ‚ú® Summary
Mass collaboration often stems from shared ideologies or mythologies rather than objective facts. Although facts are critical, an ideology founded on them can still face catastrophic failure if it disregards the broader narrative. Throughout history, dominance often lies with those who interpret ideologies over those grounded in scientific truth. As a result, scientists and engineers may develop powerful technologies, but it is the ideologues who ultimately determine how these technologies are applied, highlighting a disconnect where knowledge is often overshadowed by the authority of ideological experts.

<blockquote><b>Yuval Noah Harari</b><br/><br/>You usually convince millions of people to work on a project together by telling them some ideology or some mythology. And here, the facts don't matter so much. If you try to build a very powerful ideology and you ignore the facts, your ideology is still likely to explode with a very, very big bang. And in most cases in history, the people who are experts in nuclear physics, for instance, get their orders from the people who are experts in Shiite theology or in Jewish theology or In communist ideology or in Nazi ideology. It's the people who are experts in the truth usually get orders from the people who are experts in order. And this is something that very often scientists and engineers don't understand. That they work, I don't know, on AI, and they think that the scientists and the engineers will decide what to do with it. But no, once you produce this very powerful technology, because you know the facts about the world, then you will get the people who are experts in mythology and theology coming in and Telling you, thank you very much for producing this very powerful technology.

### ‚ú® Summary
In the wake of tragic events, some individuals rationalize violence by attributing moral failings to victims, suggesting that their lifestyles or beliefs invite punishment. This sentiment is particularly alarming when echoed by influential figures within the government and mainstream media, reflecting a troubling normalization of such viewpoints in society. The belief that those who act contrary to certain cultural or religious norms deserve their fate reveals a deeper issue of scapegoating and moral judgment amid conflict.

### [05:07] German Political Instability


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (03:08 - 05:17)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9984de1c-2956-4fe9-b6bc-333eeb810507)


**German Political Instability**

- Germany's political system is increasingly fractured in the post-Cold War era, with extremist groups gaining traction.
- Current polling suggests that traditional parties would only secure two-thirds of parliamentary seats, leaving the remaining third to extremist parties.
- The major parties refuse to collaborate with these groups, making forming a majority government challenging.
- This necessitates complex three-party coalitions that struggle to make decisions, as seen with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government.
- Any decision requires renegotiation among coalition members, hindering effective governance on various issues.

<blockquote><b>Peter Zeihan</b><br/><br/>We'll probably have those in February. The problem is that in the post-Cold War environment, the German system is really fractured, and we're seeing a lot of extremist groups getting into the political system. Traditionally, there are four parties in the German parliament. The SDP, which are the socialists who are currently controlling the government. That's where Olaf Scholz is from. You've got the Greens, who are just what they sound like, who control the foreign ministry, are in the government as well. Business libertarian group, which are also in the government, and they until recently controlled the finance ministry. And then in opposition, you've got the Christian Democrats, who at the moment are the most popular party, and if elections were held, they'd probably come in first. But all of that together, under current polling, and actually polling going back for the better part of a year, suggests that those four main parties, which have formed the entirety Of every government we've seen in Germany since 1945, would only get about two-thirds of the seats if elections were held today, yesterday, six months ago, a year ago, whatever. With the other third of the seats going to a grab bag of crackpot and crazy and radical and communist and Nazi and just generally nasty parties. The prohibition in Germany against extremism is gone, and if we were to have elections, they'd gobble up a third of the seats. Now, the four main parties have all sworn left, right, and the center that they will never rule with groups like this that, for example, don't repudiate the Nazi past. But if you're going to do that, if you're going to form a majority government where you need 51% of the seats, when a third of the seats aren't available, that means you're going to have Another three-party coalition. One of the things we've seen under Olaf Scholz, which I think the guy has done an okay job considering the restrictions he's been under. Anyway, one of the things is whenever a decision has to be made that wasn't part of the original negotiation to form the government three, four years ago, everyone has to get together And hash it out. So whether that issue is labor policy or tax policy or budgetary policy or</blockquote>

- Germany, Europe's most powerful economy, is stuck in political inertia, unable to make swift decisions due to its fragmented government.
- France also lacks strong leadership. With Britain out of the EU, there is no other cohesive and powerful European country to step up, leaving a void in European policy-making.

<blockquote><b>Peter Zeihan</b><br/><br/>This is a really bad time for Europe for this to all be happening. The Ukraine war is raging as hot as ever. And in the United States, Donald Trump is about to take over again. And if you don't have France or Germany who are basically capable of raising their voices for really any reason, then it is up to someone else to decide what Europe policy is. Trump because the Brits are on the outside because of Brexit and there just isn't another large country that is cohesive enough or powerful enough.

<blockquote><b>Jason Calacanis</b><br/><br/>There is no one else to buy the debt. So pull up the China chart, Nick. China's historically been the biggest buyer and owner of US treasuries. But here's what's happened in the the last couple of years. It peaked at about $1.3 trillion about 10 years ago. And then recently, particularly starting around COVID, they began selling down and have been selling down at an accelerated pace. Today, China is back to the</blockquote>

**Stocks vs. Bonds in Rising Rates**

- Stocks, unlike bonds, can hedge against inflation by raising prices.
- However, both are hurt by rising interest rates due to a higher discount rate, making the future cash flows less valuable.

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>The big difference between a bond and a stock is that the bond provides you with, like you said, fixed income payments, and those would be horribly debased if you have high inflation. A stock gives you earnings, and a company can always raise its prices. And so in theory, it should be hedged against inflation. But both a stock and a bond are similar in the sense that they're both hurt badly by rising interest rates, right? Because the discount rate is higher. So this is where I'm just not sure about equities is if we do head into a new regime of higher rates longer, does that hurt equities, even though equities normally are pretty good inflation Hedge? So I just don't know the answer to that. I do think we're headed for a period of constraints.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Negotiation practices allow entities to secure significant discounts between 20% to 50% during renewal negotiations.
2. Market dynamics, driven by both open source and closed source models, enable companies like Palantir to potentially underprice competitors.
3. The computing landscape is moving towards an ambient model, utilizing intuitive control systems such as voice and gesture recognition.
4. Technologies like Apple Vision Pro exemplify the transition to more dynamic user interactions with AI, enhancing experience through real-time feedback.
5. The traditional mobile handset is forecasted to become obsolete within a decade, paving the way for more seamless engagement with data.

### [38:19] Negotiation Breeds Competitive Pricing


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (37:39 - 38:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8fbe09bb-ece7-4de7-b884-2728746026a2)




### ‚ú® Summary
When entering renewal negotiations, entities often find themselves in a strong position to demand significant discounts, potentially ranging from 20% to 50%. This environment fosters intense competition as companies strive to retain or gain market share, particularly for high-stakes contracts involving substantial financial commitments. The implications for pricing strategies are profound, especially as companies like Palantir, when achieving scale, are positioned to underprice competitors by leveraging changes in market dynamics due to both open source and closed source models. The overall shift reflects a drastic reduction in pricing, marking a considerable evolution in cost per token.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Except when the renewal comes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What happens when you have to, you know, You got a really good negotiating position. On something. And then you're going to renegotiate it. You're going to spend a billion dollars again five years from now. It just doesn't seem very likely.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>There's going to be a lot of hardcore negotiations going on, Chamath. People are going to ask for 20% off, 50% off. And people are going to have to be more competitive. That's all. I suspect Palantir's go to market.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>When they start to release scale, they'll be able to underprice a bunch of these other alternatives. And so I think that when you look at the impacts and pricing, that all of these open source and closed source model companies have now introduced in terms of the price per token, what we've Seen is it's just a massive step function lower, right?</blockquote>

### [55:53] Embrace the Ambient Future of Computing

### ‚ú® Summary
The future of computing is steering towards an ambient model characterized by intuitive control systems like voice, gesture, and eye movements, as seen in technologies such as Apple Vision Pro. These systems foster dynamic interactions, enhancing user experience through real-time feedback and dialogue with AI. The traditional mobile handset is predicted to become obsolete within the next decade, making way for seamless integration of visual interfaces that allow for effortless engagement with data. This shift promises a transformative evolution in how we access and interact with information, heralding an exciting new era in computing.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>So I told open AI to start quizzing me on this thing. And I just did a 30 minute walk. And while I was walking, it was asking me quiz questions. And I would answer it and tell me I was right or wrong. It was really this incredible dialogue experience. So I think the voice controls there. I don't know if you guys have used Apple Vision Pro, but gesture control is here today. You can do single finger movements with Apple Vision Pro, it triggers actions. And eye control is incredible. You look at the letters you want to have kind of spelled out or you look at the thing you want to activate and it does it. So all of the control systems for this ambient computing are there. And then the AI enables this kind of audio response where it speaks to you. And the big breakthrough that's needed that I don't think we're quite there yet. But maybe Zuck is highlighting that we're almost there. And Apple Vision Pro feels like it's almost there except it's big and bulky and expensive is integrated visual where the ambient visual interface is always there and you can kind of Engage with it. So there's this big change. I don't think that mobile handsets are going to be around in 10 years. I don't think we're going to have this like phone in our pocket that we're like pressing buttons on and touching and telling it where on the browser to go to the browser interface is going To go away. I think so much of how computing is done, how much how we integrate with data in the world, and how the computer ultimately fetches that data and does stuff with it for us is going to completely Change to this ambient model. So I'm pretty excited about this evolution.</blockquote>

- Unrealized losses on US bank balance sheets are now higher than in 2008, potentially signaling a looming crisis.
- This is due to rising interest rates devaluing existing bonds held by these banks.

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>And I think that this number is one of the other kind of facts. You see a few articles come out here and there about this. But the number as the rates go up, the number of unrealized losses, the dollar value of the unrealized losses at banks' balance sheets in the United States has climbed so considerably That it represents a real crisis. In fact, the unrealized losses on banks' balance sheets today is higher than it was in 2008.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>It's trillions. It's trillions.

**Impact of High Debt on Real Economy**

- High debt levels prevent long-term interest rates from decreasing as expected.
- This leads to increased mortgage payments and reduced consumer spending power.

<blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>But that's not happening. And it's not happening for the reason we're saying, which is there's just too much debt out there. So now think about the impact on the real economy. Let's say that you're a home buyer and you got like a five-year interest-only arm type mortgage for your house. Tick-tock. Yeah. So now, you probably got that in the 3% to 4% range. If you have to refinance it this year at 8%, your monthly payment's going to double.</blockquote>

**US Debt Spiral**

- The US is facing a compounding debt problem due to high debt-to-GDP ratio and insufficient spending cuts.
- This could lead to economic instability, potentially challenging the US dollar's dominance.

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>And that means you've got to issue more debt to pay for your interest on your current debt. Square paradoxical. It becomes that the Fed sets that rate, right? Well, this becomes the compounding problem when your debt to GDP reaches a certain level, and you don't reduce federal spending fast enough, it becomes a compounding problem you cannot Get away from. And this has been the beginning of the cataclysmic economic collapse of every great empire in the last 500 years. I know I've said this, you guys can joke about it all day long. But this is how it starts is it starts at a point where you're at rhythmically not able to get out of your debt spiral. And the markets are telling us that if the US doesn't take drastic action in reducing its spending, and reducing the deficit levels, so that we can actually address the payment obligations On the outstanding debt that we've already issued, the US dollar is going to have a real problem. And the credit worthiness of the United States is challenged. That's what the market says. But I know that there's other issues with the fact that there's no other better place to put money today. And there's not a lot of other, you know, great economies out there and so on and so forth. But the stability of the United States, the hegemony of the United States and the dollar is challenged in part by the fact that you've got this BRICS organization out there now that has Greater GDP in aggregate than the US. And so there may be an alternative that emerges in the next couple of years. And maybe everyone's kind of putting their assets away in gold and Bitcoin and other stuff while they're waiting for the transition to find another place to buy. We'll see. All right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>Well, it's scary. But what it implies, if rates have roughly doubled, let's say, in the last few years, and they're going to stay at that level, they're not going back down, it</blockquote>

**Auction Broadcast Licenses**

- Reclaim and auction the broadcast licenses of major networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC. 
- This could create a more competitive and dynamic media landscape.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Sachs is paying attention now. But he had this tweet about taking back the licenses for the main broadcast channels. And I thought that was an excellent thing. And I quote tweeted something where I was like, yeah, we should buy that for all in. And I said it half jokingly, but I didn't. Because I think that if those licenses were up for grabs, what would happen is a bunch of private equity people would get behind Rogan, a bunch of private equity people would get behind Us, and we would all bid. And the outcome would be better. So the point is that these small structural changes, and I know that it may seem large to break up Google. It's not. It's a small thing in the grand course of American business history. It's not going to really matter that much. Would be good generally through the lens of the individual shareholder and through the lens of the shareholder of the United States. That's it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>Saks, can you tell us about the broadcast licensing comment that you made? I thought it was actually pretty good too.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>Yeah, there's a history to this. I mean, originally in the US, we had three major broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, and they were given licenses of public spectrum from the FCC. And those licenses were free, but in exchange for them, the major broadcast networks had these various requirements to serve the public interest. To be fair.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>This was pre-cable and this was broadcast over the air.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Chamath Palihapitiya</b><br/><br/>This goes back like a hundred years.</blockquote>

**Media Shift to Emotive Content**

- Legacy media has shifted from objective reporting to emotive content to drive engagement.
- This is a response to the democratization of information through the internet.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>David Sacks</b><br/><br/>Think we've talked about this a number of times in the past. So without rehashing too much, I think that many of the institutions that have offered media have had to move away from providing data and information because data and information Has commoditized. It's available broadly through the internet and other places. So the actual gathering of information is now democratized. You know, agencies put their data on their website, stock markets are published on the internet. So the internet has democratized access to information. So the media companies that have historically been arbiters of information have had to become effectively content businesses. They've had to provide more than just information. And what has happened is a iterative feedback system whereby the more kind of angry they can make someone, the more upset they can make someone, the more emotive they can make a reader Or a viewer or a listener, the more clicks they get, the more the kind of limbic system triggers that consumer to come back and consume some more of their media. And so the iterative development cycle is that things look like they're one side versus another side in nearly every context. In every piece of media, everyone is opinionated and making a position point from a side, from a perceived side that they are representing, because it is a motive to the readers and the Readers come back and they align with that side and they want to have more of that because it incites their limbic system. So that's what's happened. And as a result, when people look at it and assume that it's what it used to be, which is objective truth, fact finding, information gathering, and it is not that, they're like, well, This isn't even news anymore. And the truth is it's not because information is democratized. It's available to you anywhere and everywhere you want it. You can get it through citizen journalism, via blogs, via podcasts, via Twitter, via many other places. And so the legacy media companies have effectively become emotive content companies in order to drive clicks, drive views, sell ads. That's really all this whole story is. And I don't think that that's going to shift. I don't think that Jeff Bezos' attempt to try and return WAPO back to being a fact-finding organization is going to be successful. I think all the consumers that read WAPO today, they love the one-sided nature. They love the bias that they read. It makes them feel good. I think that the people that work there love the bias. They love writing those opinion pieces. It makes them feel good. I don't think anyone actually wants boring news anymore because you know what? They can go to a website from the government itself or from a company itself and just read the information. And frankly, if they want to get unbiased, honest, factual information, there's 100 other sources. Well, and then here on the commentary, the comment, yeah, the commentary about off the cuff, etc. You know what that is? That's called authentic conversation. That is how people speak. When we all get together, we are not journalists, we are not necessarily well versed.</blockquote>

**Drunk vs. Sober**

- How a person acts while intoxicated can reveal their true character. 
-  A common expression is, "Does the drunk agree with the sober?" 
-  If someone's personality changes drastically when drinking, it can be a warning sign.

**CEO Compensation and Government Overreach**

- Use progressive tax policy to address excessive CEO compensation, like an 80% alternative minimum tax for those earning over a billion dollars.
- Avoid government intervention in setting "fair" compensation, as it represents overreach.
- Respect the capitalist principle of asset owners deciding compensation, even if outcomes seem unfair.
- Boards of Directors, elected by shareholders, should determine CEO pay.
- Address wealth inequality through taxation rather than judicial decisions.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>So as ridiculous as this is, I think the board got it wrong. The way I think you handle this is through a more progressive tax policy. I think anyone making over a billion dollars should pay an alternative minimum tax of 80%. But the moment judges start talking about what is fair or not fair in compensation, I just think it's government overreach. I think she got this wrong.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Kara Swisher</b><br/><br/>Yeah. Well, she's reacting to a shareholder lawsuit too at the same time, right?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>Of a minority of shareholders. The majority of shareholders have approved this pay package.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Kara Swisher</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it's true. He'll probably get it. He'll get it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>If you own a building and you pay the maintenance people or the person running the building an outrageous amount of money, that's what you get to do if you own the building. And the majority of the owners of this company have decided he's going to get a hundred. I get it. I get it. And also, I hate defending Elon Musk, but when they awarded the options package, it was worth single digit billions. So, so in the analogy I would use is that if they can't, if Cook- I think it was always 40 billion.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Kara Swisher</b><br/><br/>I think it was always 40 billion. Go ahead. Go ahead.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>G (Scott Galloway)</b><br/><br/>Anyways, if Tim Cook went to his biggest shareholders and said, we're worth 3 trillion, I think I can make this company worth 20 trillion, but in order to do that, and I'm the singular Person that can do this, I want a trillion dollars. I think at that moment, a majority of shareholders might go, a trillion dollars is ridiculous, but sure, if you can make this thing where 20, we'll give you a trillion. And that's kind of what he did here. So again, I think fairness and the support of the greatest innovation in history, the American middle class, is through a progressive tax structure. But a key component of capitalism is the owners of an asset get to decide what to do with it, including the compensation.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Kara Swisher</b><br/><br/>Yeah, that's what I said.</blockquote>

**Kernthemen des Wahlkampfs**

- Der kommende Wahlkampf dreht sich um die Frage, in welchem Staat wir leben wollen.
- Themen wie Handlungsf√§higkeit, Infrastruktur, soziale Sicherheit und Wirtschaft stehen im Fokus.

<blockquote><b>Dagmar Rosenfeld</b><br/><br/>Der Bundestagswahlkampf hat begonnen. Wie hart wird er werden? Welche Strategie fahren die Parteien? Und wer hat eine Chance aufs Kanzleramt? Frank Staus ist Werber, Politikberater und SPD-Mitglied. Er hat √ºber 25 Wahlk√§mpfe begleitet, viele f√ºr die SPD, unter anderem f√ºr Klaus Wovereit, Kurt Beck, Hannelore Kraft und auch f√ºr Gerhard Schr√∂der. Seine Sicht auf den Wahlkampf, die h√∂ren wir jetzt. Guten Morgen, Herr Staus.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Frank Stauss</b><br/><br/>Guten Morgen, Frau Rosenfeld, ich gr√º√üe Sie.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Dagmar Rosenfeld</b><br/><br/>Herr Staus, Sie haben f√ºr die SPD ja schon so manchen Wahlkampf organisiert und Ihre Erfahrungen, die haben Sie in einem Buch aufgeschrieben. Und in diesem Buch hei√üt es, es ist Wahlkampf, ihr Sissis. Ich finde, das ist ein super Satz. Wenn Sie den jetzt beginnenden Wahlkampf mit einem Satz betiteln m√ºssten, wie w√ºrde dieser Satz lauten?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Frank Stauss</b><br/><br/>Ihr werdet euch noch wundern. Wor√ºber werden wir uns wundern, Herr Staus? Ich bin total √ºberrascht, wie viele Beobachter jetzt schon wieder wissen, wie diese Wahl ausgeht, obwohl wir so viele Wahlen gehabt haben, in der sich innerhalb von wenigen Wochen Die Anteile der Parteien so dramatisch verschoben haben und die W√§hler einfach sehr verunsichert sind und jetzt nat√ºrlich noch verunsicherter als 2021, dass ich wirklich der festen √úberzeugung bin, dass sich in diesem Wahlkampf und auch am Wahltag noch einiges tun wird.</blockquote>

- Scholz und Merz sind beide unbeliebt, aber Merz ist weniger bekannt.

<blockquote><b>Dagmar Rosenfeld</b><br/><br/>Ist aber doch, Herr Staus, dass die SPD mit dem unbeliebtesten Politiker Deutschlands als Kanzlerkandidaten ins Rennen geht. Was soll in wenigen Wochen passieren, dass die Deutschen doch noch ihr Herz f√ºr Olaf Scholz entdecken?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Frank Stauss</b><br/><br/>Das ist halt die Herausforderung. Deswegen macht man ja Wahlk√§mpfe, damit sich Dinge √§ndern. Manchmal √§ndert sich dann am Ende trotzdem nichts. Aber ich glaube, wir werden eine Zuspitzung erleben in diesem Wahlkampf. Und der ist ja auch schon angelegt, wo es wirklich im Kern darum geht, in was f√ºr einem Staat wollen wir eigentlich leben in Deutschland? Wie handlungsf√§hig soll der sein? Wie soll unsere Infrastruktur aussehen? Wie viel wollen wir aber auch in soziale Sicherheit investieren? Und auf der anderen Seite geht es um die Wirtschaftsfragen. Das hei√üt, ich sehe einen klassischen Wahlkampf um Wirtschaft und Soziales. Und das halte ich f√ºr eine ganz spannende Frage, weil das eigentlich ein substanziellerer Wahlkampf werden kann als die, die wir in den letzten Jahren erlebt haben. Und gleichzeitig kann es sein, dass also die gro√üen Spalterthemen wie Migration in diesem Wahlkampf geringere Rolle spielen und damit auch die R√§nder eine geringere Rolle spielen.</blockquote>

> There are no perfect candidates. But what do you do when both candidates are not just imperfect but deeply flawed, and seen by many as unqualified for the job?<br/>>   <br/>>  We are just one week away from a presidential election that will decide if the next four years are helmed by Vice President Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump. I know many people who are still undecided. Some of them work at  The Free Press .<br/>>   <br/>>  These undecided voters have just one presidential debate to reference, and as my friends at  Open to Debate  said in a   Wall Street Journal  op-ed : ‚ÄúI can confidently state that we haven‚Äôt yet seen a real presidential debate this year. Debates have devolved into political theater, with combative candidates, biased media, agenda-driven moderators, and a fixation on social-media sound bites. This structure fails to deliver the substance voters need.‚Äù<br/>>   <br/>>  So today, we are here without the pageantry, makeup, or muted mics, to host not Trump vs. Kamala‚Äîthough the invitation is still open‚Äîbut instead two very smart people who represent each side of the choice that we are going to make a week from today.¬†<br/>>   <br/>>  Sam Harris is a neuroscientist, philosopher, best-selling author, and host of the podcast  Making Sense . Today, he will explain why he is voting for Kamala Harris. Sam has spoken passionately and consistently on this issue since Trump came onto the scene; Sam calls him ‚Äúthe most dangerous cult leader on Earth‚Äù and highlights Trump‚Äôs character flaws. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse; he mocked a disabled reporter; he said John McCain wasn‚Äôt a hero; he called veterans ‚Äúsuckers and losers‚Äù; if we kept going with examples, we‚Äôd be here all day. Sam‚Äôs biggest issue is January 6 and Trump‚Äôs refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. Sam writes, ‚ÄúThe spectacle of a sitting president refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, culminating in an attack on the Capitol, remains the most shocking violation of political norms to occur in my lifetime.‚Äù¬†<br/>>   <br/>>  On the other side, Ben Shapiro‚Äîlawyer, co-founder of  The Daily Wire , best-selling author, and host of  The Ben Shapiro Show‚Äî will explain why he is voting for Donald Trump. Ben argues that we were a better country under Trump and that his policies make us safer and more prosperous. There were no hot wars, no inflation crisis, and less traffic at the southern border with Trump as president. He makes the case that Trump will not be abandoned by the experts who advised him during his first administration, and he will delegate responsibilities to capable and trustworthy policymakers. He also argues that Kamala is an ‚Äúincompetent and unqualified vice president‚Äù and that ‚Äúradicalism defines her.‚Äù¬†<br/>>   <br/>>  I suspect if you‚Äôre listening to this show, you know these two names and have listened to their shows before. It is not an exaggeration to say that Ben and Sam are two of the smartest, most influential, and most insightful voices on the American political scene. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we‚Äôre so thrilled to host this conversation today. The other is because it‚Äôs exactly the kind of conversation we need more of in this country, especially at this moment. I challenge you to think of  one  debate you heard during this election that was passionate and provocative, but also civil and respectful, between a Trump supporter and a Harris supporter. I can‚Äôt think of one. That‚Äôs why we put this together. And we really think you‚Äôre going to appreciate what you hear.<br/>>   <br/>>  If you liked what you heard from Honestly, the best way to support us is to go to¬† TheFP.com ¬†and become a Free Press subscriber today.<br/>>   <br/>>  Learn more about your ad choices.

And more importantly, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon account for roughly 40% of NVIDIA's sales. So what we're seeing here is a dynamic where, you know, NVIDIA is pretty much propping up the stock market. We've all kind of identified that. And NVIDIA's entire top line is being propped up by the CapEx bend of Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. So in a way, that CapEx number is the most important number in the entire global stock market right now. We should all care a lot about how much they're spending. But as you mentioned, the competitive aspects to this, the idea that they're all ramping up spending,</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Current political landscapes reflect a blend of extreme views, particularly those adjacent to QAnon and Trumpist populism, which demand serious consideration rather than dismissal as mere fiction. The past actions and statements of political figures from 2019 indicate a shift in ideology that might complicate future political dynamics, including potential outcomes in elections. The enduring presence of Trumpism poses a challenge that cannot be overlooked; even a narrow loss for Trump risks perpetuating his influence. Recognizing these concerns and the roots of political extremism is essential for fostering a comprehensive understanding of contemporary political realities.

That's how crazy 2019 was over in in Wokastan, in the Democratic Party. You know, she just smiled and looked at him like he was a madman in the debate. And that, you know, that was probably the right thing to do given the needs of the moment. Because believe me, I want her to win the presidency. But the problem is, if you drill down on the on the concerns of many these people who are QAnon-adjacent in this fever dream of Trumpist populism, it's not all fiction. This has been a long sidebar conversation. But I just think the problem is that if you treat it as just all lies in the aftermath of the election, however it goes, my big fear is that Trumpism doesn't go away. I mean, like, is your expectation that if Trump loses narrowly, he... I mean, what is your expectation of Trump and Trumpism in the aftermath of a Harris victory in November?</blockquote>

### [16:06] Balance is Key: Delegate Wisely


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (14:46 - 16:08)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a6948c9-2c5f-42b3-bd82-e7d3756b4363)




### ‚ú® Summary
CEOs must strike a balance between direct involvement and delegation to maximize organizational output. Over-delegation leads to inexperience handling critical tasks, while micromanagement stifles productivity. Successful companies have demonstrated that reducing layers of middle management can enhance efficiency and performance. This approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on overall output rather than getting trapped in hierarchical routing of tasks. Understanding the dynamics of 'founder mode' versus 'manager mode' plays a key role in optimizing leadership effectiveness.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And obviously, if the CEO tries to do everything and make every decision, probably that's not going to result in the maximum output. Conversely, if you delegate everything, I call it the problem of infinite delegation where CEO delegates to VP, VP delegates to director, director delegates to manager, manager Delegates to the summer intern. Yeah, you know, and then all the most important work in the company gets delegated all the way down to the newest, most inexperienced people, that's not going to work either. Yeah. So again, you're gonna have to find the right balance. And again, the way that you figure out what the balance is, is to apply gross principle of maximizing the output of the team or the organization.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And we've seen in some of the big company sacks that they've cut out middle management, because so much of the work was just being playing telephone and handing it to the next person that When you took out that swath of people at Facebook or Google or Microsoft, right? The company seemed to work better. Yeah, great. Because you're taking out a layer of overpaid people.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And it just took out a huge amount of middle management and it didn't seem to harm the performance. Performance got better. And again, you can apply gross principle, look at what happens to the aggregate output. So this topic has been addressed at length and I think has been understood for decades. Maybe the only new thing here is a little bit of branding around founder mode versus manager mode.</blockquote>

### [24:00] Think Uniquely, Lead Effectively

### ‚ú® Summary
Successful founders and leaders excel by understanding their companies and human capital intimately, rather than relying on cookie-cutter approaches or conventional wisdom. They think from first principles, allowing them to devise unique strategies tailored to their specific business models. This critical leadership trait enables them to identify the necessary means to achieve their organization's mission, emphasizing the importance of ignoring comparables and convention in favor of original thought.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>And they each did it uniquely.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I don't think there's a single way in which any one of those companies is run, that necessarily you could have cut and pasted it to the other companies and have it worked. So it requires a smart individual who understands their company and their human capital intimately well and their business model.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>By the way, what's important about what you just said, Chamath, is that that is effectively, I think, the definition of, like, being a successful founder, understanding from first Principles. So these are leaders that can think from first principles, not necessarily from comparables. Most managers are caught in business school. Here's how a business is run. Here's how this person did it. Here's how this company did it. And then they go and they try and cookie cutter repeat that. That doesn't really work, because every business if it's going to be successful, it has to be unique. And so the ability to actually think uniquely and identify from first principles, the means necessary to achieve the mission of the organization, I think is a critical, critical leadership Trait. Maybe that, yeah, that leader can come from a founder or not. But this ability to kind of ignore convention, ignore comparables and think for yourself.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I don't see most founders starting a business because they've done some first principles analysis.</blockquote>

### [25:07] Fearlessness Fuels Founders

### ‚ú® Summary
Most founders embark on their entrepreneurial journeys not due to rigorous first principles analysis but rather because they identify a perceived gap in the market. The primary traits driving these founders are fearlessness and a degree of naivety; an excess of knowledge might deter them from taking the leap. Before achieving product-market fit, qualities such as risk-taking, curiosity, and relentless iteration are crucial, contrasting with the analytical thinking needed afterward. While transitioning skills can evolve, a title alone does not guarantee the necessary characteristics for success, highlighting the stark reality behind the high failure rate of startups, where 95% ultimately do not survive. The journey to building a unique business is marked by rare abilities to initiate and adapt.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I don't see most founders starting a business because they've done some first principles analysis. I see most founders starting companies because they see a gap that they're pretty sure exists. But I think the biggest thing that founders have is this intersection of fearlessness and naivety. And so if they knew too much, they would never do it. That, I don't think, necessarily means that the entire set of all of those people are actually great first principles thinkers. The first principles is required after product market fit. What's required before product market fit is risk taking, curiosity, relentless iteration, and those are a very different set of characteristics. Is it true that sub-founders can then change their toolkit? Absolutely. But is it true that, quote unquote, because you have a title, you have those things? Absolutely not. Otherwise, we would have a much higher success rate in Silicon Valley than we do. There is a reason why 95% of these companies go to zero. It's because the ability to do the first thing is rare, and then the ability to transition is even more rare.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Well, building a unique business.

### [57:52] Algorithms Serve as Modern Editors

### ‚ú® Summary
Algorithms are increasingly designed to evolve and optimize their ability to engage users based on current trends. Companies are generally aware of these trends and, while they may not intervene in real time, they create frameworks that capture and amplify viral content. This raises questions about responsibility, especially in the context of Section 230, as the code governing these algorithms is not deterministic. There's a need for a nuanced discussion on accountability, recognizing that these algorithms function like modern editors that shape content dissemination.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I think it is a fig leaf to say that we've, there's a level of abstraction that should give us immunity. I think that these algorithms are taught to iteratively become better and better at hooking people on whatever is trending in that moment. And I think it's probably known to these companies at any given time what's trending. So even though they're not literally going and changing something in the moment, does it mean that they don't support it. And doesn't mean that they're not aware of it. And it doesn't mean that they haven't created a net to sort of catch these lightnings in a bottle and spread them around. And so I think we just need to have a more intelligent discussion about how responsibility should be shared in a world where section 230, yeah, you're right, I'll just say it again, we're Not writing deterministic code anymore. It doesn't say if this, then that show them the blackout video, there is no piece of code anywhere. But it's kind of a fig leaf to say that that isn't the intention of the way that the new form of software is written.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, correct. Sacks your thoughts here on balancing 230 with the fact that I think we all agree that these algorithms are the new modern day editors.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Editorial bias can distort perceptions of news, leading to a conflation of op-eds with objective reporting. Unlike traditional editorial stances, algorithms are designed to reflect individual preferences by curating content based on user interaction. Users who engage with certain types of content, such as controversial or offensive material, will see more of it due to the algorithm's reinforcement of their interests. To reduce exposure to undesirable content, individuals should consciously avoid engaging with such material, as the algorithm will adjust accordingly. This showcases the fundamentally different approach algorithms take compared to editorial editorializing.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>If you look at an editorial page of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, it has a very specific point of view that is promoting. In fact, sometimes you can't tell the op-ed page from the news page because it seems like that publication is so biased in favor of one point of view or another. An algorithm isn't supposed to do that. An algorithm is supposed to give you more of what you want. And so therefore, if you are pro-Trump, you'll see more pro-Trump content. If you're pro-Kamala Harris, you'll see more Harris content. In other words, X or whatever the platform is, isn't supposed to be taking an editorial position on whether it supports Trump or Harris, but rather, it's giving you more of what you want. Elon recently spoke to this, he had a tweet recently where he talked about, hey, people are coming to him saying, hey, I'm seeing all these like offensive things in my feed. Why is this? Well, it turns out that they had been sharing those posts that were offensive to them. And so they were seeing more of them. And that's a really good example of how the algorithm just gives you more of what you're interacting with. So don't interact with outrage porn. If you don't want to be outraged, stop interacting with outrage porn and you'll see less of it. I just think that is fundamentally different than having an editorial point of view. X does not have an editorial point of view that it wants you to see more of that outrage.</blockquote>

[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:02:58 - 01:04:39)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8b02885-410c-41ff-a86c-ac348342665a)




### ‚ú® Summary
Consumers are primarily driven by emotional connections to content, preferring experiences that evoke strong feelings such as fear, joy, or inspiration. This emotional engagement leads to increased desire for similar content, creating a feedback loop that reinforces viewing behavior. In the digital media landscape, feedback cycles are accelerated; social media platforms provide immediate insights into audience reactions, allowing for rapid content iteration based on viewer engagement. Consequently, content that is emotionally compelling tends to maintain viewer interest and engagement, indicating that the challenge is not merely about algorithm choices, but rather about fostering emotional resonance in the content delivered.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I'm not sure that giving people a choice of an algorithm is going to work consumers just want to have stuff that insights emotion. There's a reason, you know, horror movies do well, and also romantic comedies, and also adventure films, like they're all emotive. At the end of the day, the more emotive something is the more emotionally inciting it is, the more likely you are to kind of want to have something like that again. And so that's simply the nature of how, you know, humans interact with the world around them. When something is emotionally inciting, you want more of it and you get more of it and that creates the dopamine and that drives the behavior. Or digital media, firstly, is that the cycle, the feedback cycles much faster used to be that you put out a book, you wouldn't get the results on how the book sold and how many people liked It and how many people read it till a year later. And then with movies, you get results in a weekend. But with social media, you get results instantly when a piece of content comes out online, you get an instant result. And then with the concept of a feed, where the next content is dynamically selected for you based on your reaction to the content prior to it, you kind of get this immediate feedback loop That then tunes and lines up the next thing and now you're getting hundreds of iterations an hour. So I'm not sure that there's really this like, simple solve where let me show you something that's like less inciting at the end of the day, if it's something that's horrific or something That's romantic or something that's inspiring, if it's emotionally kind of activating enough, you're going to be happy watching the next one, you're going to keep watching and you're Going to keep watching it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think there is a relatively easy solve, which is you could simply open source the algorithm like X has done.</blockquote>

### [01:19:21] United We Stand Against Division


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:17:59 - 01:19:19)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/82edd19f-f3a5-40a3-a6b7-de936d094440)




### ‚ú® Summary
Compromise occurs through the influence of external actors rather than directly within leadership, as individuals surrounding influential figures may exploit relationships for personal gain. The intended strategy involves sowing discord and division among citizens, diverting attention from critical international issues. The goal is to unify Americans, promoting a collective stance against outside interference in democratic processes, and to resist politicizing the threat posed by such actions.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Now- I never said Trump, no, no, I have to correct that. I never said Trump was compromised. I said the people around him were compromised because they kept taking meetings and money from the Russians. And this is the Russian playbook. No, I believe putting a words aside and claims like this. And you're telling me what I think you can ask me what I think. And I can tell you very clearly again, that I think their plan is to find simple minded people to give them money and to cause chaos and division in our country. I don't think that they got to Trump. I think they got to almost everybody around him. And if you look at those people who show up at Putin dinners and you look at who takes money, it's all around Trump. And the Russians are experts at this. And they did it to the Green Party. They just sprinkle money around people to cause this type of chaos. That's the goal, Seng. How many times do I got to say this to you? Clearly, I don't have a horse in this race. I think all Americans I'll say it again so that you can understand it and the audience can understand my position very clearly Their goal is to get us to fight with each other so we don't Look at their invasion of Ukraine or what's happening with the suffering of the Russian? People and we as Americans should not be partisan on this issue. We as Americans should all come together, you, Sax, me and everybody else, and say, we don't want the Russians interfering in our elections or causing division. And we're not going to make this political.</blockquote>

### [15:57] Konsequenzen f√ºr Plattformen wie Temu und Shein

**Konsequenzen f√ºr Plattformen wie Temu und Shein**

- Patrick Zahn argumentiert, dass Plattformen wie Temu und Shein vom Markt ausgeschlossen werden sollten, wenn sie systematisch gegen deutsche und europ√§ische Gesetze versto√üen.
- Er zieht eine Parallele zu station√§ren Gesch√§ften: Wenn diese wiederholt gegen Brandschutzauflagen versto√üen, werden sie geschlossen.
- Zahn betont die Notwendigkeit, die Verbraucher zu sch√ºtzen und fordert eine Anpassung der Gesetze, um den Staat in die Lage zu versetzen, gegen diese Plattformen vorzugehen.

<blockquote><b>Patrick Zahn</b><br/><br/>Ich gebe Ihnen ein einfaches Beispiel. Wenn wir bei KICK in einer Filiale dreimal gegen Brandschutzauflagen versto√üen, wird die Filiale geschlossen. So einfach ist das. Ich halte das auch √ºbrigens f√ºr absolut richtig. Und so berechtigt ist das ja auch. Ja, deswegen sage ich, ich halte es f√ºr richtig. Wir m√ºssen daf√ºr sorgen, dass wenn was in unseren Ferialen passiert, dass wir das in Ordnung bringen und wenn nicht, m√ºssen wir schlie√üen. Das gleiche gilt f√ºr die Plattformen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gabor Steingart</b><br/><br/>Das hei√üt, Sie w√ºrden sagen, diese Plattformen m√ºssen, wenn sie so auch systematisch versto√üen gegen deutsche Gesetze, europ√§ische Gesetze sind es ja oft schon, dann m√ºssten die Vom Wettbewerb ausgeschlossen werden.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Patrick Zahn</b><br/><br/>Das ist richtig. Die Herausforderung ist nat√ºrlich, es sind Plattformen. Der eigentliche Produzent sitzt nat√ºrlich in China, die Plattform vermittelt nur. Nur dann m√ºssen die Gesetze daraufhin angepasst werden, dass es Handhabung f√ºr den Staat gibt,</blockquote>

> We re experimenting and would love to hear from you! <br/>>  Deep in Utah s Fishlake National Forest lies Pando, the world s largest known living organism - a remarkable quaking aspen that appears to be a forest of 47,000 individual trees but is actually a single interconnected being. This 106-acre giant, weighing approximately 6,600 tons and surviving for an estimated 14,000 years, reproduces through a unique process called suckering, where new stems sprout directly from its vast underground network. However, this ancient marvel faces unprecedented threats from overgrazing by exploding deer and elk populations, climate change, and human development, causing it to fragment into three distinct sections. Conservation initiatives, including strategic fencing projects and wildlife management programs, are racing to protect this remarkable organism, whose preservation represents not just saving a single entity, but protecting a complex ecosystem that supports hundreds of dependent species and provides crucial insights into forest resilience and adaptation.

**Ver√§nderte Schuldzuweisung in China**

- Fr√ºher suchten die Menschen in China die Schuld f√ºr pers√∂nliche Misserfolge bei sich selbst.
- Studien zeigen, dass sich dies ge√§ndert hat.
- Heute geben die Menschen dem System und der Regierung die Schuld f√ºr ihre Probleme.
- Sie empfinden das System als ungerecht und sehen ungleiche Chancen.
- Dieser Wandel in der Schuldzuweisung k√∂nnte zu steigendem Frust und gesellschaftlichen Spannungen beitragen.

In der Form, dass sie sich gesagt haben, okay, es geht mir schlecht, ich habe mich nicht genug angestrengt. Ich verdiene wenig, ich bin nicht gut genug. Ich habe in der Schule nicht genug getan, an der Uni nicht genug getan. Ich bin selbst schuld. Und bei dieser besagten Untersuchung von einem Bildungs√∂konom, der Scott Rosell hei√üt, stellte sich dann heraus, als er diese selbe Untersuchung jetzt unl√§ngst nochmal gemacht Hat. Das ist heute komplett, zehn Jahre sp√§ter, v√∂llig anders. Heute ist es so, die Menschen geben nicht mehr sich die Schuld, sie geben dem System die Schuld.

**Shrinking Federal Workforce**

- Lay off large numbers of federal employees across the board, potentially by shutting down entire agencies.
- Encourage federal employee resignations by requiring a return to five-day in-office work weeks, ending post-COVID work-from-home arrangements.
- Relocate federal agencies outside of Washington, D.C., anticipating many employees will choose not to move.

<blockquote><b>David Fahrenthold</b><br/><br/>They refer to a plan where the president could just lay off huge numbers of federal employees across the board. You know, there are civil service protections that prevent individual employees from being fired for their political beliefs or other reasons, but they believe the president could Just simply shut down an agency. They also float some kind of more creative efforts that would make employees quit so they wouldn't have to be fired. One is to make federal workers come back into the office five days a week, ending what they call, you know, the sort of unnecessary post-COVID privileges. And the other was to relocate federal agencies out of Washington. I think about 85% of federal workers don't work in Washington, but there are a lot, obviously, who are here in Washington where I am. You know, President Trump can use executive action to say, okay, the headquarters of this agency is no longer Washington. It's somewhere else. And trust that a lot of people won't want to relocate. And so the federal workforce will decline in the process of moving them. Got it. And then finally, they say they want to look around the federal government to cut wasteful spending. That means both cutting entire programs, spending programs that they don't agree with. It also means trying to make existing programs like Medicare or the Pentagon run more efficiently finding and cutting waste or fraud.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sabrina Tavernise</b><br/><br/>OK, so it sounds like an op-ed, right? Here's how I'll cut the federal government in five easy steps. It'll be so quick, so easy.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Fahrenthold</b><br/><br/>It's funny you say that.

### [16:51] Deutscher Mittelstand als Vorbild


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (15:20 - 16:51)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4b6fe2c9-88a8-4733-a5b2-c9e5fb144142)


**Deutscher Mittelstand als Vorbild**

- Der deutsche Mittelstand, insbesondere Familienunternehmen, dient als Beispiel f√ºr ethischen Kapitalismus.
- Diese Unternehmen priorisieren Vertrauen, vermeiden Kurzfristigkeit und betrachten ihre Mitarbeiter als Teil einer Familie.
- Deutschland gilt als f√ºhrend im ethischen Kapitalismus, teilweise aufgrund der Nachkriegsordnung und der sozialen Marktwirtschaft.
- Den deutschen Wirtschaftsvordenkern, oft im Widerstand gegen Hitler aktiv, lag bereits ein ethisches Verst√§ndnis von freier Wirtschaft zugrunde.
- Japan, mit seiner √§hnlichen Unternehmenskultur, wird als potenzieller Kooperationspartner genannt.

<blockquote><b>Markus Gabriel</b><br/><br/>Gibt es das. Das ist auch eines der R√ºckgrate unseres sogenannten Mittelstandes. Aber das ist in der Tat die Struktur. Ob das jetzt 3D-Drucker in M√ºnchen sind, da habe ich gerade interessante Pers√∂nlichkeiten kennengelernt. Das ist ja auch eine starke Szene in Deutschland. Oder egal, wo man in Deutschland hinschaut, sitzt da in der Tat die M√∂glichkeit des ethischen Kapitalismus. Und das hei√üt, wir sind eine f√ºhrende Nation in dieser Angelegenheit oder ist das schon wieder zu arrogant gedacht, Deutschland als f√ºhrende Nation des ethischen Kapitalismus versus Des US-Kapitalismus, der sich selber oligarchisiert? Ich glaube, wir sind zuf√§llig f√ºhrend, weil wir das Gl√ºck im Ungl√ºck hatten, dass die Nachkriegsordnung uns die soziale Marktwirtschaft abgen√∂tigt hat, strukturell. Das liegt nat√ºrlich auch daran, dass die relevanten Vordenker und Vordenkerinnen der Bundesrepublik, die Wirtschaftsvordenker, die Ordoliberalen und so weiter, k√§mpfen ja schon W√§hrend des Zweiten Weltkrieges, waren die ja im Widerstand. Das vergessen heute die, die gerne den Neoliberalismus kritisieren, dass diese Leute im Widerstand gegen Hitler sich ihre Gedanken gemacht haben √ºber eine freie Wirtschaft, wie Dem auch sei. Im Widerstand gegen einen Staatskapitalismus, wenn man so will. Genau, von vornherein gab es da einen ethischen Aufruf. Das findet man aber woanders auch, sehr stark in der Schweiz, wo das auch ein sehr gut funktionierendes System ist, vor allen Dingen aber auch in Japan. Ich w√ºrde denken, Japan k√∂nnte f√ºr uns jetzt ein interessanter Kooperationspartner auf Augenh√∂he sein, weil man dort nat√ºrlich auch die gro√üen Familiennamen hat. Das steckt ja in den gro√üen Unternehmen. Auch Langfristigkeit eine Rolle spielt und eine sehr ethisch ausgerichtete Unternehmenskultur. Danach kann gar</blockquote>

> Vivek Ramaswamy burst onto the national scene last year as a wild card candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Here was a relatively unknown biotech executive with no political experience, pitching himself as someone who could carry on Donald Trump‚Äôs movement. Trump ultimately won that primary contest handily, but Ramaswamy was a breakout star. There was even chatter that he might be Trump‚Äôs V.P. pick.<br/>>  Trump, of course, ended up choosing JD Vance ‚Äî Ramaswamy‚Äôs friend and former classmate ‚Äî who has a very different vision for the future of Trumpism. But Ramaswamy believes the future of the Trump movement is still up for grabs and is fighting hard for his camp to win out over the one that Vance represents, including in his new book, ‚Äú Truths: The Future of America First .‚Äù<br/>>  In this conversation, we discuss the two competing visions that Ramaswamy sees as lurking beneath the surface of Trumpism, what he calls ‚Äúnational protectionist‚Äù and ‚Äúnational libertarian,‚Äù whether his vision is really so different from Paul Ryan-style conservativism, why he thinks these debates within the Republican Party are really deep down about identity and what it means to be an American.<br/>>  Book Recommendations:<br/>>   The Constitution of Liberty  by Friedrich Hayek<br/>>   The Bhagavad Gita <br/>>   The Road to Serfdom  by Friedrich Hayek<br/>>  Thoughts?

**Making Government Jobs Sexy**

- Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy could make government jobs more appealing.
-  Their marketing prowess and focus on attracting "super high IQ" individuals might draw talent to government service.

<blockquote><b>Ed Elson</b><br/><br/>Popular post. I mean, people were liking it. They were commenting on it. They were saying, let's fucking go, you know, and it's a very bro-y comment section. But what it has done clearly by putting Elon and Vivek in charge is that these great marketing tools for attracting talent, because I think previously one of our biggest issues in America Has been that it's not cool to work for the government. But clearly what's happening here is, you know, whether you like Elon and Vivek or not, they're clearly making it sexier to work for the government. And that tweet, you know, the way that they're sort of making it exciting that we're going to be cutting costs in an unglamorous way, but we need the smartest people in America to help Us do it. That, to me, is the right direction. And if using Elon and Vivek are the ways to do it, I'm actually all for it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>\"Scott Galloway\"</b><br/><br/>I like that. I think that's really insightful. And you're absolutely right. We need to make government jobs aspirational. And if we can use two aspirations educational, you know, very successful men to create that aspiration around government work. I love how you're calling balls and strikes. And I think that's true. I think that is a positive and anything that attracts brighter human capital into government service, that is the silver lining here.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Ed Elson</b><br/><br/>Yeah. They just need to be honest about what this is all for. And if this just becomes a giant talking point to own the libs, this is not productive.</blockquote>

No, they just did that because they were trying to do the morally correct thing, because of the million people, something like 850,000 of them were men, and that really doesn't help The demographic situation in the long run. That's before you consider things like language and cultural and skills barriers. If the Germans really wanted to solve their demographic problem with immigration, they would need to bring in about 2 million people a year under age 25 every year from now on just to Hold the line. You know, after 20 years, it's not Germany anymore. If you're going to use immigration to stave off a demographic problem, you need to do two things. One, you need to start early before you have much of a problem. And two, you have to have some assimilative capacity so you don't generate big culture clashes. You want it to be a trickle, not a flood.</blockquote>

**A New Party and the End of the Democratic Party**

- With shifting political factions, a new MAGA party is emerging, distinct from the traditional Republican alliance.
- This realignment signals the end of the Democratic Party as we know it, as minority groups and organized labor shift allegiances.

<blockquote><b>Peter Zeihan</b><br/><br/>So number two, with political factions in motion, a new party is being born. Now, I can't tell you right now if the current alignment that brought Trump to power for his second term is a permanent feature of MAGA, and it is MAGA. This is not the Republican alliance. It's something new. But what I can say, it is the end of what we think of as the Democratic Party. Remember, minorities, organized labor, educated white coastal elites. Well, organized labor is now at best from the Democratic point of view, a swing vote. And over half of them did vote for Trump. But minorities is really where it's at. The fastest growing demographic in the country, largely due to immigration, is Hispanics. And Hispanics, people always seem to forget this. Hispanics are the group in the United States that are most opposed to migration in really any form. And so when Donald Trump made a lot of his pitch about the southern border, it really resonated with the people who at one point crossed. And organized labor out of the Democratic Alliance means that any places where those two pieces matter for local politics all of a sudden are, at best, up for grabs. And that means without some significant soul-searching and, more importantly, some significant alignment shifts, white coastal educated elites, that's not a party. That's a book club, and it can't win federal elections. Third, we're</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Berlin's history of the Berlin Wall includes the Death Strip, a deadly no man's land between the parallel walls where over a hundred people were killed trying to pass during the Cold War. This macabre space is crucial to understanding Berlin's transition to the technocene era. Gazina's family lived in Soviet-controlled East Germany, with her father falling afoul of the Stasi secret police, leading to repercussions.

That negative space is the death strip, patrolled by guards with guns, dogs, surrounded by barbed wire. It was called the death strip because over a hundred people were killed trying to pass. The death strip is Berlin's defining scar, but it's also crucial to our story today, weirdly because it's the cradle that will eventually birth the city's technocene. But for Gazina as a kid, before there's the music, there's just the wall. Her family lived in the Soviet controlled east, the GDR. Kuzina's father ended up on the wrong side of the secret police there, the Shtazi, for what sounded to me like the dumbest possible reason.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The family's move from East to West Berlin led to challenges as parents became distant, leaving the siblings alone. The migration left a lasting impact on Gizina, with East being a bad memory for her parents and the West shaping her family in a difficult way. The area near the Berlin Wall now serves as a monument, highlighting the transformation from a once-dangerous zone to a field covered in artwork, portraying the vast nature of the former death strip.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Gazzina's family moved to the part of West Berlin that was specifically for people coming in from the East. As she describes it, a quasi -refugee camp. Life there would end up being challenging. Her brother was badly bullied in school and turned around and bullied her. Her parents, who had been much more present in the East, now disappeared into work, leaving her and her brother home alone with the television. For her parents, life in the East was the bad memory. For Gizina, who left all that so young, it's the West. This strange new country that changed her family. They left a bruise that stuck around. Okay, so where are we?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So this is part of the wall, which is like now a monument east side gallery. We put lots of different along the wall.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We're standing with our backs to what's left of the east side of the Berlin Wall. It's covered in street art and graffiti now. Nearby there's a field of grass and dirt and then the river. Honestly, as far as monuments go, it's not much. The wall fell in November 89 and the two cities that had been kept apart to join each other. It's strange to think that this place where we're talking, anyone standing here would've been shot. It's just a field.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>This would've been the death strip, because then the canal was also part of the wall or of the no -go area, and then behind it is Coitsberg on the other side.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The size of this strip is pretty crazy.

### ‚ú® Summary
Proper body composition is essential for having a healthy level of body fat and skeletal muscle. The brain primarily relies on carbohydrates for energy, with about 130 grams attributed to brain usage. Individuals engaging in cardiovascular and brain-intensive activities may require more carbohydrates, with a rough estimate of 250 grams being suggested for those doing light resistance and cardiovascular training. This amount, providing four calories per gram, may help maintain appropriate glycogen levels for such activities.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You know, I think that if people care about body composition, which I would say everyone should because you want to have an appropriate level of body fat and healthy skeletal muscle, Then you wouldn't necessarily, unless you're doing some kind of cardiovascular activity, you're not using a ton of glycogen, depending on how much you're training.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And how much glycogen is the brain using?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So that is a good question. The brain uses a lot of carbohydrates. That would be a primary source. When they come up with the numbers of 130, it's really based on brain and then the rest of the Can we safely say that for somebody that's thinking a lot, they need more carbohydrates? You could say that then your brain, yes, your brain is very metabolically active.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Interesting. So we're gonna drawing rough estimates, not knowing people's body weight, not knowing their body composition, but what I'm arriving at here is, you know, if somebody does a little Bit of cardiovascular training, maybe a little bit of light resistance training, I'm describing the activities of many people out there, maybe 250 grams of carbohydrates, you're Kind of at the threshold. That's a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot. Four calories per gram of those carbohydrates.</blockquote>

### [29:52] Importance of Protein in First Meal of the Day

### ‚ú® Summary
Consuming between 30 to 50 grams of protein in the first meal of the day stimulates muscle protein synthesis, which is crucial for overall muscle health. This protein intake also benefits skeletal muscle health, influences brain function, enhances satiation, and impacts appetite regulation for subsequent meals. Research shows that a high-protein first meal can improve food choices later in the day, aiding in better dietary adherence and willpower.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That first meal of the day is important because we know that when you get between 40 and 50 grams of protein, that first meal of the day, you stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Muscle protein synthesis is proxy what we use to measure as a marker for overall muscle health. Now there's a lot of history here when we think about designing a meal plan. That first meal has between, we'll say, give it between 30 to 50 grams of dietary protein. That will do a number of things. Number one, it will stimulate skeletal muscle, what we would consider the health of skeletal muscle. It also will affect the brain. It'll improve satiation. You and I were talking previously. It releases a handful of gut peptides.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Like glucagon -like peptide 1, which later we'll talk about.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah,, PYY, things that will affect appetite for that second meal. And there's some very interesting research out of Heather Leidy's lab. And basically, when she put individuals, younger adolescents, on a meal of 30 to 40 grams of protein, they were much less likely to choose, say, donuts or something outside of what we Would consider a healthy nutrition plan.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Later in the day or in the same meal?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Later in the day. So it was essentially augmenting their willpower.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Okay, so it sounds like for young people, they can delay breakfast if they want. For older people, probably not. But that the first meal of the day should include what you're calling dietary protein, 30 to 50 grams. And maybe we should talk about the quality of that protein, because I think a lot of people understand</blockquote>

### [35:56] Quality of Protein and Human Body Composition

### ‚ú® Summary
Proteins like eggs, whey protein, beef, and poultry have a high quality as their amino acid composition is similar to the human body composition, necessary for skeletal muscle health. In contrast, plant-based proteins have a composition similar to plants and one can get essential amino acids by consuming a high enough caloric load of these proteins. It is essential to recognize that the American diet is predominantly plant-based, consisting of refined carbohydrates, sugars, cereals, and oils.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, now the quality of protein is defined by the amino acid composition. And typically animal -based proteins have higher quality. These are hard, fast biological numbers. The dietary protein in say a steak is very similar to the protein amino acid in skeletal muscle. So the quality of the proteins like eggs, like whey protein, like beef, like poultry, those compositions are similar to the human body composition. So they contain the amino acids in the appropriate ratios for skeletal muscle health. Now, plant -based proteins have a different composition and they have a composition obviously similar to plants. And one can get enough of the essential amino acids if the total caloric load of that protein is high enough. And I think that that's important to recognize because right now the American diet is 70% plant -based and we seem to be moving more towards a plant -based diet.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I know there's sort of a movement toward that. You hear about plant -based, but so most people are not eating steak and eggs for breakfast.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We know that.

### [36:56] Balancing Plant-Based and Animal-Based Proteins


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (35:36 - 37:02)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02fee153-2ffd-4bec-bb9c-286c7fcf223e)




### ‚ú® Summary
A balanced diet consists of 70% plant-based foods and 30% animal-based proteins to ensure proper nutrient intake. While animal-based proteins offer essential nutrients like zinc, selenium, and B12 crucial for muscle health, plant-based proteins can also suffice if the overall protein intake is sufficient. It's important to be mindful of the carbohydrate content that accompanies plant-based proteins and to choose protein sources wisely to meet amino acid requirements. A rice pea blend of protein can be a suitable alternative for those leaning towards a plant-based diet and avoiding animal proteins.

Well, most people, when I say 70% plant -based diet, I'm talking about refined carbohydrates, sugars, cereals. Refined oils. And when we think about it, so that 70% of our diet comes from that where 30% comes from animal -based proteins, which contain a ton of nutrients like bioavailable zinc and selenium, B12. But when it comes to muscle health, one could, as long as they are thinking about making sure that the overall protein load is high enough in that plant -based protein. For example, one would not choose quinoa as a protein source. So quinoa would, six cups of quinoa would equal the same as one small chicken breast when it comes to an amino acid profile. So I think one has to be aware that plant -based proteins typically have carbohydrates that ride along with them. And that just becomes important for overall metabolic control when we think about total caloric load and carbohydrates. Someone could use a rice pea blend of protein for that first meal. That would certainly be sufficient. Certainly if someone is geared towards a more plant -based diet and doesn't want to consume animal proteins, that's what I would use.</blockquote>

### [21:21] Defending Western Values to Clarify Moral Confusion on Gaza Conflict

### ‚ú® Summary
A defense of Western values could address the confusion about Gaza fueled by misinformation against Israel. The perpetuation of lies labeling Jews as colonialists, apartheid builders, and genocide perpetrators has misled many. Despite efforts to educate and correct, the false narratives persist, exacerbated by distressing images from Gaza. The unequal power dynamic between Israelis and Palestinians often leads to a misperception of moral equivalence, attributing more responsibility to Israel due to its perceived strength. However, the reality showcases Hamas's genocidal actions, targeting non-combatants and manipulating women and children in the conflict.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I'm suggesting that a real defense of Western values would solve that problem, among many others. Nevertheless, it is easy to see why some of our kids are confused about Gaza. They are being inundated with misinformation about Israel, that the Jews are settler colonialists, that they have built an apartheid state, that they are guilty of genocide. These lies did not start on October 8th. They have been promulgated for decades. And it seems that no matter how patiently one corrects them, nothing changes. And the photos coming out of Gaza certainly don't help. As I've said before, there is no political analysis or moral argument that makes sense of images of dead children being pulled out of rubble. It's also natural for people to look at the history of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and imagine that there's some moral parity between the two sides. In fact, because Israel has become more powerful, most people imagine that the responsibility for the ongoing conflict falls more on the Jews. Israel is now perceived to be a bully with advanced weaponry. And the Palestinians are merely victims throwing rocks. Even in the aftermath of October 7th, when you had an avowately genocidal organization like Hamas, butchering non-combatants and taking women and children hostage, and firing rockets By</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Islam views non-Muslims ruling over Muslims as unacceptable and strives for dominance in the world both spiritually and physically. The failure to achieve dominance is seen as a source of perpetual humiliation and sacrilege. This attitude towards achieving victory has influenced various aspects of Islamic interactions, such as the long-standing challenges in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Islam, from the first moment, was a religion of power. The idea of non-Muslims ruling over Muslims, or even having equivalent power alongside them perpetually, has always been anathema. It's an error to be rectified through spiritual struggle, sure, but also through physical violence. The fact that Islam has failed to achieve dominance in our world, and has proven for nearly a thousand years to be quite backward and weak, is a perennial source of humiliation. By the light of the doctrine, it makes absolutely no sense. It is a sacrilege. From the point of view of Islam, the status quo is intolerable. And this general attitude of a fronted dignity, this yearning for victory, which century after century, has been out of reach, affects everything that Islam touches. It's why the history of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians has been so hopeless. Have the Israelis made mistakes? Of course. Do the Jews have their own religious fanatics? Yes. But the peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians has been rendered</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Focusing on historical grievances in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians often obscures the present dynamics and potential resolutions. Each group's interpretation of history is subjective, making it challenging to find common ground. A more pragmatic approach is to assess the actual intentions of any group when given power‚Äîwhether they act benignly or display sociopathic tendencies. This perspective is critical for understanding the ethical and political implications of their actions and aspirations, regardless of historical narratives.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Tend not to want to do when talking about specifically what's happening between the Israelis and the Palestinians is to get drawn into the history. Because I think just pragmatically speaking, there's no resolution to be found there. I mean, everyone has their variant view of the history or the variant waitings they give to each of the facts that they agree are in fact facts. And there's this arbitrary decision of just how far you set your way back machine to kind of start the clock of grievances and vendetta, or to cash out anyone's claim to territory. I think the thing that really does clarify the question, ethically and politically, and this is true now and it'll be true 100 years from now, is just to ask what would any specific group Of people do if they had the power to do it, right? I mean, actually, if you gave any group what they say they want, and you gave them the power to do whatever they want, just, you know, how benign or sociopathic are their actual intentions?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Emotional attachments to religious beliefs can create a complex interplay in conversations about faith, influencing both the individual's struggle for meaning and their appeal to others. These attachments, although they may seem inconsistent or elastic, serve as emotional ballast, affecting how one engages with the subject of religion. The distinction is made between those who wrestle emotionally with their beliefs and those who approach the topic with a clinical rationality, highlighting the challenge of connecting with someone who is not reasoning logically or arguing honestly.

Whether he's really a Christian or a fallen Christian or a Christian who's trying his hardest or just what is Christianity really doing for him and how tied in knots is he over it? How much of his appeal to his audience is his wrestling with the emotion around all of that? I mean, that's just not happening for me at all. I can be super clinical and honest and rational over all of that terrain. Maybe there's some terrain like that that I could be pushed on to where I'm going to get tied in knots. But when you see someone who's smart, who's either not reasoning logically or not arguing honestly, and they're just dancing around either of those two errors, and you can't make them Converge on the way you see these obvious errors.</blockquote>

### [37:42] Walking: The Pill for Longevity


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (36:27 - 37:44)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e58cf381-8060-4457-956c-18945cfbab29)




### ‚ú® Summary
Walking is a remarkably effective health intervention, akin to a powerful medicine, with evidence suggesting that walking just 7,000 steps a day can lead to up to a 70% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Further studies indicate that increasing steps to between 8,000 and 12,000 can reduce mortality risks by 50 to 65%. Regular walking is associated with significant reductions in various health issues, including Alzheimer's, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression, and cancer. The emphasis is not solely on the number of steps but on consistent engagement in walking to enhance overall health and longevity.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would say at least three. I would say aiming for more than that is good though. So to just give a sense of the picture of walking, if walking were a pill, it would be the most impactful pill we've ever had in all of modern medicine. There was a paper in JAMA, 6,300 participants followed for 10 to 11 years. And the people who simply walked 7,000 steps per day compared to less than that had in up to 70% lower risk of all cause mortality in the follow-up period. So not causality, but it's pretty incredible. They've done follow-up research with slightly different numbers showing, again though, like many thousands of people in the study followed for about 10 years, 8,000 to 12,000 steps Per day was associated with 50 to 65% lower all cause mortality. And this has been played out in many studies showing about a 50% reduction in Alzheimer's dementia, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression, cancer, gastric reflux, just all across The board. And I think the key thing is that it's not about the steps.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Sustained small amounts of movement throughout the day can activate glucose channels more effectively than infrequent intense exercise. For example, a person who incorporates brief walking or exercise breaks every 30 minutes maintains active glucose processing, as these muscle contractions keep the glucose channels at the cell membrane. In contrast, someone who works out hard for one hour but remains sedentary for the rest of the day may not benefit as much, since their glucose channels remain inactive inside the cell for long periods. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize regular muscle engagement over sporadic exercise.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>They're not on the cell membrane. So of course that's going to keep the glucose in your bloodstream not being processed by the mitochondria. So when we think about steps, it's a proxy metric for just moving more throughout the day. So let's take two people. You have a person who's walking for one to two minutes every 30 minutes throughout the day. Maybe they're exercising at the end of the day or the beginning of the day. Maybe they're not. That person is stimulating glucose channels to be at the membrane all day. Now let's take another person who works out really hard for one hour in the beginning or the end of the day. They feel great about it. They've checked that off their box, but they're sitting the entire rest of the day. Yes, they have gotten the benefits from the exercise, but for a lot of that day, those glucose channels are inside the cell, not doing the work they could be doing. So I think about these little teeny short walking breaks or pushup breaks or air squat breaks every 30 minutes or so throughout the day as me essentially inside the cell pushing the glucose Channels, the cell membrane to make them constitutally active. It's totally different physiology and it's so easy. So it's not about the steps. It's about muscle contraction regularly throughout the day.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Resistance training has become increasingly popular and accessible to a diverse range of people, marking a significant cultural shift from its past niche status. Activities such as yoga and cardiovascular training have similarly gained mainstream acceptance. Engaging in simple movements, such as taking short walks post-meal, has proven to be highly effective in managing blood glucose levels. Research indicates that even a brief 10-minute walk can lead to a dramatic reduction in glucose response, enhancing the body's ability to utilize energy more efficiently. This movement activates metabolic processes in a way that sitting does not, making it a crucial recommendation for health improvement.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Very interesting because I think a lot of people are now working out, so to speak, doing resistance training, which I think is terrific. Terrific. Used to be such, you know, so restricted to niche subculture stuff like bodybuilding, preseason football, military, et cetera. And now it's more ubiquitous for everybody, men, women, young, old, that's terrific. Same thing with things like yoga and cardiovascular training. I mean, I like to study the history of exercise culture and it wasn't, but in the 60s when you know, jogging was considered kind of like, whoa, that's like a really esoteric niche culture Thing. So lots of change. I love the prescriptives you gave because it's just very straightforward. A couple of short walks. It just makes so much sense. And I love the visual and I hope people will really hold it in mind. So I'll reiterate it. The translocation of these energy utilization stores, vesicles, as you call them, these little packets from the center of the cell out to the cell surface where then they can be involved, Excuse me, in metabolic processes and the utilization of energy in ways that otherwise they wouldn't end glucose disposal being a big part of this. So I have heard that a short walk after a meal will reduce blood glucose in a way that's really dramatic.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Huge amount, 30, 35% just taking a walk around the block after a meal. That's definitely a prescription I think everyone should do because the research is so strong on it is that building in simply a 10 minute walk around the block or a dance party in the Kitchen, moving your muscles for 10 minutes after a meal can drastically reduce your glucose response because you're just bringing all those channels to the membrane, you're taking Up the glucose, you're using it. It's a whole different physiology than sitting on the couch after a meal that's very high impact. It's high leverage if it's after a meal. So highly recommend that. And the levels data and clinical data has shown that out time and time again.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Different types of exercise‚Äîwalking, resistance training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), endurance training, and zone two training‚Äîeach uniquely stimulate mitochondrial function. Endurance and zone two exercises promote mitochondrial biogenesis, essential for cellular energy production. HIIT enhances mitochondrial fusion, optimizing cellular efficiency. Resistance training supports muscle hypertrophy, requiring increased mitochondrial content for muscle cell energy. Current physical activity guidelines recommend engaging all major muscle groups thrice weekly along with 75 to 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity weekly. However, a significant portion of the American population fails to meet these basic fitness standards, with 20% completely inactive.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you take sort of each type of exercise. We've got walking, we've got resistance training, we've got high intensity interval training, we've got endurance training, and then we've got sort of more like zone two. So we've got these different flavors of how we get our heart rate up, how we get the blood flowing, what we signal to the cells. And each one actually has like a slightly different impact on the mitochondria. When we think about biogenesis, we're thinking mostly like endurance exercise and really more of that zone two. And like that is really going to be a stimulus inside the cell to print more mitochondria. When we think about improving mitochondrial fusion, high intensity interval training is really, really good for that. When we think about resistance training, it's like that's like muscle hypertrophy. We're going to be creating more muscle cells and we need more mitochondria for those. So each one has kind of a different impact. And I think this is where honestly, I think the regular guidelines that we have even by our government, you know, actually make a lot of sense. Like work every major muscle group three times a week in a resistance type training and then work to get 75 to 150 minutes of moderate to strenuous activity. So 75 minutes of strenuous activity or 150 minutes per week of moderate activity. So that actually makes a lot of sense. 80% of Americans are not meeting those very basic guidelines and 20% of Americans don't get any physical activity really at all.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Incorporating slow walking into a daily routine, even at a speed of one mile per hour, can significantly contribute to achieving daily step goals. Just two to three hours of walking can yield six to eight thousand steps, supplemented by short walks throughout the day. This approach counteracts the sedentary lifestyle typical of modernity and promotes regular movement, which is essential for good physiology. Engaging in such low-impact activities can positively affect body composition and is an accessible, cost-effective way to enhance physical health. For those without specialized equipment, setting reminders to take walks during the day can also be effective.

But it, it, it's incredible how even at a 1.0, 1 mile per hour speed after two to three hours, you're easily going to get six, seven, eight thousand steps and then throw in a couple other Short walks throughout the day and you're, you're getting there easily. So it's just a, it's just a great way to build back in what modernity took away. And that unfortunately is unavoidable that, that regular movement for good physiology. So I'm a big fan of them and the data suggests that for a couple hours a day, they can actually have a, have an impact on body composition, which I think is, is a great, easy, inexpensive Thing for people to do. But if you, if you don't want to buy one, like just set those timers and, and build in the walks, you know, throughout the day outside.</blockquote>

### [01:00:40] Prioritize Your Health with Basic Tests


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (59:43 - 01:00:37)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d2c8da0e-6199-4f9b-b703-b031897ba0c9)




### ‚ú® Summary
Individuals should proactively engage with their health records and consult their doctors to obtain essential health tests that are fundamental for understanding metabolic syndrome. Key tests include fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Many of these basic tests are commonly included in annual physicals and can provide crucial insights into one's health without significant resistance from healthcare providers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You've got the big ones. So this, this is key is that every single person listening, I hope after this episode, will go to their health record or send their doctor a message and at least get the following test. The first seven that I'll mention are very basic and people might take umbrage to them because obviously there's a lot of debate about what's everyone's favorite lab test. I think about it as like what are the basics that everyone should know and then what's like the next tier up that are easy to access and are cheap that'll give you a lot more richness but Which you still might have to kind of fight your doctor for. So the first few that you will not have to fight your doctor for and are often free on an annual physical and literally define metabolic syndrome are fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol, waist circumference and blood pressure.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Understanding your health metrics is crucial for optimal metabolic health. Key indicators include fasting glucose under 100, triglycerides below 150, and a HDL cholesterol level over 40 for men or 50 for women. Additionally, hemoglobin A1c should be less than 5.7%, total cholesterol to HDL ratio should be below 3.5 to 1, and waist circumference must be under 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men. Maintaining blood pressure below 120 over 80 is also essential. Achieving these ranges without medication signifies being optimally metabolically healthy.

Oh, your glucose is high. We need to break down. Oh, your blood pressure is high. We need to bring it down. But what I'm inviting people to do is understand a little bit about each test and then read the tea leaves of what it's telling us about our mitochondria. So let's start with fasting glucose. So fasting glucose, when you look at these studies that I'm referring to, they call optimal less than 100. So to define whether you were in that 88 or 93%, you had to essentially be in the, their optimal range for all biomarkers, not on medication. So I'll quickly run through what their ranges were. My ranges for optimal are tighter than these. But fasting glucose less than 100 triglycerides less than 150 HDL above 40 for men or 50 for women. Humilibane, when see less than 5.7%, total cholesterol to HDL ratio less than 3.5 to 1, waist circumference less than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men and blood pressure less Than 120 over 80. If those things were in those ranges and you weren't on medication for blood sugar or, or blood pressure or whatnot, you were considered optimally metabolic healthy.</blockquote>

### [01:06:58] High Triglycerides Reflect Cellular Dysfunction


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:05:16 - 01:07:02)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f02220b7-72cf-49fd-b306-8424bd0fa62d)




### ‚ú® Summary
Triglycerides serve as indicators of excess carbohydrate intake and may reveal underlying metabolic dysfunction. When mitochondria are impaired, they struggle to process glucose and fatty acids, resulting in higher blood glucose levels as these substances are blocked from entering cells. Elevated fasting glucose signals potential issues within cells that prevent proper nutrient absorption, leading to increased glucose in the bloodstream. The body, aiming to maintain homeostasis, converts excess glucose to triglycerides for storage. Consequently, high levels of both glucose and triglycerides in lab results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic overnutrition, highlighting a broader metabolic imbalance.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So the triglycerides are a reflection of excess carbohydrate intake. And how it's helping us with that tapestry of understanding the trifecta of bad energy is that if you think about it, let's just go back to that cell and that poor mitochondria that's Being absolutely decimated by our environment and its capacity is low. Okay. So that might get mitochondria is like, I can't process glucose or fatty acids to ATP very well. So I'm going to block their entry into the cell. So now you've got glucose rising in the bloodstream. So okay, fasting glucose, that was one of our biomarkers. If that's going up, that is a little bit of that tapestry of maybe something's going on inside the cell that's blocking the entry into the cell. So it's rising the bloodstream. Okay. Well, where's all that? The body does not want lots of glucose floating around in the bloodstream because it can literally independently cause endothelial dysfunction, which is basically blood vessel Problems. It can cause oxidative stress in the bloodstream. It can cause glycation, which is sugar literally just sticking to things. The body doesn't want that glucose high in the bloodstream. So it converts it to triglycerides to be stored in a storage form of energy. That's a key point that I think is helpful to understand is that the body, it's always trying to like kind of keep things in the right range. So it'll convert things. So then triglycerides, a picture in your blood of glucose being high and triglycerides being high is very much should signal to everyone when they look at their labs that there's probably Something going on inside inside the cell that's blocking the cell from being able to use and process. It's a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic overnutrition too much substrate, not enough processing. Glucose is going to go up. Triglycerides are going to go up. And so then if you kind of squint and read the tea leaves, it's like, huh, I think metabolic dysfunction.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic overnutrition lead to increased glucose and triglyceride levels, pointing towards metabolic dysfunction. Healthcare systems often overlook patients with glucose and triglycerides on the upper end of normal ranges, potentially missing signs of insulin resistance. Optimal health is indicated by lower levels of glucose and triglycerides, which reflect effective energy processing in cells and prevent excess conversion to triglycerides. Thus, striving for optimal biomarkers, rather than merely normal ones, is crucial for better metabolic health.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic overnutrition too much substrate, not enough processing. Glucose is going to go up. Triglycerides are going to go up. And so then if you kind of squint and read the tea leaves, it's like, huh, I think metabolic dysfunction. The thing is that the travesty in our healthcare system is that a patient might go into the doctor and they're fasting glucose is 99, one point under what we'd consider the normal range And their triglycerides are 149, one point under what we'd consider the normal range from these things. That doctor might say to that patient, you're totally fine. Both glucose and triglycerides are normal, but that's just really problematic because they're on the upper end of normal for both of those. And so really what that would say to me is someone thinking about the mitochondria is like this person is definitely metabolically dysfunctional. They're on the highest end of normal for both triglycerides and glucose. There's something, there's definitely insulin resistance going on here. I would much rather see that glucose at 73 and that triglyceride at 50, which to me would say, oh, this cell's processing through energy. Great. And things are moving through. And we're not backing up in the bloodstream. We're not converting to triglycerides. So that's where really optimal ranges get in. So that's glucose and triglycerides. Why?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
High levels of triglycerides and glucose can indicate insulin resistance and potential metabolic issues. Optimal ranges for glucose (around 73) and triglycerides (around 50) suggest effective energy processing without excessive accumulation in the bloodstream. Elevated markers, such as hemoglobin A1C, signify an increase in glycated hemoglobin due to prolonged high glucose levels, which negatively impacts red blood cell function. Maintaining hemoglobin A1C below 5.7 is crucial for ensuring red blood cells remain functional and free from dysfunction caused by sugar attachment.

And that's glycation. So you're looking at glycated hemoglobin. And you can imagine that if the concentration of glucose is higher over time, more glucose is going to stick to red blood cells. And that's going to create a higher percentage of glycated hemoglobin. So that's why that lab is represented as a percentage. So less than 5.7 is what we want.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You want those cells nice and smooth and slippery.

### ‚ú® Summary
Many patients face resistance from doctors when requesting specific tests, such as fasting insulin levels, with roughly 85% likely to be denied. This creates a demand for innovative solutions outside traditional healthcare systems. Direct-to-consumer lab testing companies, such as Function Health, Inside Tracker, Next Health, and Levels, are emerging to provide affordable options for comprehensive health monitoring. By facilitating access to 110 biomarkers for under $500 twice a year, these services empower individuals to take charge of their health without battling healthcare providers. Frequent testing, ideally three to four times a year, can help reduce confusion caused by conflicting health information and strategies, enabling clearer decision-making regarding personal health management.

So I actually think there's a huge benefit. I hate to say it, but like going outside the system, this is where I think innovation has been valuable. There's a lot of amazing companies doing direct-to-consumer lab testing so you can basically avoid the hassle. And some of them are very affordable. There's... Function Health is a company that's doing 110 biomarkers, including all the key metabolic biomarkers for less than $500, and they'll do it twice a year. So you don't ever have to... And then they do interpretations. Inside tracker, next health, levels is doing labs. And so there's a lot of this springing up because I think people are sick of fighting with their doctors to get a crumb of information about their health. And it's... It's... We should probably be testing these, I would say, three to four times a year. And the beauty is that like, I think a lot of what keeps people down in the health world is that they're confused about what to do. There's a lot of noise. There's a lot of different strategies.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The trend of sharing health metrics on social media underscores a shift towards a more scientific and quantitative approach to personal health, moving beyond mere aesthetics. Monitoring various health parameters, such as fasting glucose and cholesterol levels, encourages individuals to take proactive steps in improving their metabolic health. Essential factors influencing metabolic wellness include nutrition, sleep, physical activity, emotional health, exposure to toxins, light, and temperature regulation. Individualized strategies leveraging these factors are crucial, as different people may need to prioritize different elements based on their unique health profiles.

Yeah. It's fun. I think it speaks to a more scientific or at least a more quantitative approach to things. And I think it's inspiring for people. Thanks for putting those scripts in the book that people can refer to. Let's say that I go in for these blood tests. I do the basic seven and I find that my fasting glucose is a little high. My triglycerides are a little high. My LDLs a little high. Maybe a few other things are okay. So I'm kind of in them, you know, not in the red zone, but I'm in the like, mmm, should probably pay attention to these things. What are some of the things that one can do in order to try and move those needles in the right direction? I know we talked about walking and movement before. What are a few others?

I think on the highest level, it's about running through what are the science based things that we know in our environment can lead to metabolic dysfunction and take honest stock of How those factors are playing out in your life and then choose a few to start moving in a different direction. So the ones that I think are ones that we can really control and that are we know based on the science or impacting our mitochondrial metabolic health is the food, the sleep, the movement, The emotional health, the toxins are in our relationship with light and our relationship with temperature. And your journey to optimal metabolic health might be totally different from mine because I might really need to focus on the food and the sleep and the emotional health.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Modern industrial agriculture often results in food that is significantly lower in essential micronutrients, reducing the health benefits of our diets. To counter this, focus on consuming real, unprocessed foods from nutrient-rich soil to enhance nutritional value. Prioritizing five key components in your diet‚Äîfiber, omega-3 fatty acids, adequate healthy protein, probiotics, and high-antioxidant sources‚Äîwill help fulfill the cellular needs for nutrition, prevent hunger, and support a healthy weight. Stocking up on preferred items from these categories and creatively combining them in meals can lead to a healthier, more satisfying diet.

What we want to do is basically expand the value of that substrate we're putting in the body and that means real food unprocessed from good soil. We need the needs of the cells. Naturally, don't be hungry. Maintain a healthy weight. Something I talk about is that we could talk about nutrition and the biochemistry of nutrition all day. In my review of the biology and the biochemistry, there's five main things I think we can strive for in our food that can really help meet the needs of our cells. When it really comes, there are obviously more things our body needs. If we strive for these five things, we will ultimately, I think, eat a really healthy diet and that is fiber, omega-3s, adequate healthy protein, a good amount of probiotics and high Antioxidant sources.

### ‚ú® Summary
Increasing GLP1 levels in the body involves two key strategies: inhibiting the enzyme DPP4, which rapidly degrades GLP1, and enhancing the production of L cells that secrete GLP1. DPP4 inhibitors are highlighted as a significant avenue for raising GLP1 levels, essential for effective health interventions. Additionally, promoting the growth of L cells can be achieved through dietary changes that encourage the production of short-chain fatty acids, primarily sourced from fiber-rich foods. By supporting gut health and microbiome diversity through a fiber-heavy diet, individuals can potentially increase their GLP1 production and overall metabolic health. This holistic approach contrasts against the pharmaceutical industry's focus on drug solutions, encouraging a deeper understanding of natural methods to enhance health outcomes.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Cells of the gut, each of those cells makes more GLP1 and importantly, we can also inhibit the inactivator of GLP1, which is an enzyme called DPP4. So GLP1 actually gets rapidly degraded by DPP4 in the body. So if we can figure out how to inhibit DPP4, we can raise our GLP1 levels. What is DPP4? It's an enzyme that breaks down GLP1 rapidly. Thanks. I think you said that and I missed it. I apologize. It's so fascinating. I've seen in the headlines, oh, here's some strategies to inhibit your DPP4. Never because Ozempic is on track to be the highest grossing in human history. And just like we talked on the beginning of the episode, the whole industry, this $4 trillion health care industry is desperate for us to not understand how to do the things that drugs Could do for us. So when we look at those three first principles approaches of how do we make more L cells, let them produce more GLP1 from each L cell and then inhibit the breakdown of the inhibition of DPP4. For the first one, we know that short chain fatty acids, which of course are the byproduct of microbial fermentation of fiber in the diet, stimulates the differentiation of more L cells In the gut. So more short chain fatty acids, more L cells. Can we translate that into support the gut microbiome? Eat more fiber. Eat more fiber. And we had Justin Sonenberg from Stanford on a world expert in gut microbiome.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Homemade sourcrowd can be a cost-effective alternative to store-bought versions, but caution is essential to avoid unhealthy fermentation. Consuming fermented foods and their brines is beneficial for gut health, primarily due to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbiota. To enhance SCFA production, increase dietary fiber intake, which acts as a prebiotic, and incorporate polyphenol-rich foods found in colorful fruits, vegetables, spices, and teas. Fermented items like kimchi, Greek yogurt, and low-sugar kombucha promote the creation of SCFAs, supporting overall gut health and microbiome function.

It's online. Or you can buy sourcrowd and the brines, drinking the brine off the sourcrowd or off seems to be good for the gut.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's such a great point, which is that ultimately we want the short chain fatty acids, which is the medicine that the microbiome are making for us through the microbial fermentation Process. And we can basically do that in three ways. One is we can eat more fiber, which is prebiotics. We can also eat more polyphenols because we're now learning that the microbiome actually processes, they ferment polyphenols from our, which is basically you'll find those in colorful Fruits and vegetables, spices, teas, cocoa, things like that. So fermentation of polyphenols and fiber to short chain fatty acids, which for them we absorb. And then like you just said, in a fermented food, the bacteria in that food will be making short chain fatty acids by fermenting the food in there. And then if we drink that, we're getting the short chain fatty acids directly. So that's the kimchi, sourcrowd, Greek yogurt, kavos, which I'm obsessed with, which is like low sugar kombucha. It's like made with fermenting beets basically. It's such good stuff. It's so natto. So that's one that has been shown to differentiate more L cells in the gut.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Thylakoids, found in the chloroplasts of plants like spinach, play a crucial role in enhancing health. Research shows that consuming 100 grams of spinach daily, which provides 5 grams of thylakoids, significantly increases GLP-1 secretion, leading to lower hunger levels. This effect, seen after 12 weeks, highlights the power of thylakoids in promoting satiety by inhibiting lipase in the gut, allowing more fat to reach the distal small bowel. Therefore, incorporating raw or minimally cooked spinach into the diet can effectively regulate hunger hormones and improve overall satiety.

So chloroplasts, and this also is fascinating, because chloroplasts are basically the plant version of mitochondria, essentially. And thylakoids are a molecule in the chloroplasts. And there's actually been research that shows that when you eat about 100 grams of spinach, which gives you 5 grams of straight thylakoid. For 12 weeks daily, it led to a significant increase in GLP1. And again, I don't remember the exact, it was two or threefold higher secretion. So that's a direct-symmatory effect of the L cells. And so this equates to 3.5 ounces of spinach a day, which is like nothing. So just getting those.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Raw spinach or cooked spinach?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think I actually, I don't think it actually, it might have said in the methods, but I would imagine raw because you want to get those undenatured thylakoids in the gut. So just kind of another, actually, thylakoids do a lot of other interesting stuff. They inhibit lipase in the gut. And so actually help more fat get down to the distal small bowel and promote satiety. So this is one of the reasons why you talk about, oh, the people who eat all these healthy foods in greens, they're less hungry. It's like, it's biochemistry. There's stuff happening in there that is making the hunger signals go down through things like inhibiting lipase, improving GLP1 secretion.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Cold exposure serves as an effective tool to communicate with mitochondria, prompting them to generate more heat. This method, while not a replacement for food, sleep, or exercise, can stimulate mitochondrial activity and help increase the production of brown fat, which is dense in mitochondria and plays a critical role in energy expenditure. Additionally, heat exposure activates heat shock proteins that bolster metabolic health by enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms and mitigating oxidative stress. Although cold and heat are valuable strategies, they should complement, not substitute, essential lifestyle factors like nutrition, rest, and physical activity.

And you know, we know, of course, it can help. And the other data, you know, is mixed, but like increase brown fat, which is like mitochondrial dense fat and have it do more work and whatnot. So ultimately brown fat is mitochondrial dense fat and we want to, you know, help promote that. So that's all use cold. And then on the heat side, you know, just fascinating how that's kind of acting to help metabolic health through the activation of the heat stock protein, some of which have, you know, The ability to upregulate antioxidant defense systems and quell some of that wildfire that we talked about that can hurt our mitochondria. So I put them lesser on my list. But, you know, because we just can't, we can't avoid the food and, you know, the sleep and the, and the movement, but I think it's a great tool that we can use.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I love it. I will just point out that the reason the brown fat is brown at all is because of the density of mitochondria. Yeah.</blockquote>

### [02:09:11] Fasting: Align Eating with Your Body's Clock


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:07:47 - 02:09:09)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb72e795-fd99-4e62-bb5f-777ceb73371b)




### ‚ú® Summary
Fasting encompasses more than merely abstaining from food; it involves strategic timing of meals to enhance metabolic health. Research suggests that compressing eating into daytime hours aligns with our biological rhythms, yielding better health outcomes. A controlled study indicates that consuming the same calorie intake within a six-hour window leads to significantly lower glucose and insulin levels compared to spreading the intake over twelve hours. This highlights the importance of meal timing, advocating for a method that respects our diurnal nature to optimize metabolic health.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The way I conceptualize the idea of fasting, obviously this is one where we need more words, right? Because the word fasting is so limited. There's so many different parts of this. But skipping breakfast for me would be that or skipping dinner.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Sometimes I'll skip dinner, sometimes I'll skip breakfast.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Right. I think that some of the most interesting data that I've seen has been about if we reasonably compress our eating into daytime hours during the part of the diurnal cycle when we are supposed To be eating. So essentially matching our chronobiology with our behavior, which, you know, we are diurnal organisms. So we kind of need to respect that. Like when we do that and we compress it in a moderate way, our metabolic health is better. And so some of the studies that have looked at this, one that was interesting was, and I think very hopeful for people is that if you take all the food, all the calories that you're going To eat and eat them in a six hour window versus a 12 hour window, totally same amount of calories, exact same food. This is a controlled experiment. People who eat the same amount of calories in a six hour period are going to have much lower, statistically significantly lower glucose, 24 hour glucose in insulin levels compared To people who just space it out over the course of a 12 hour period.</blockquote>

### [02:16:07] Eat Early for Better Metabolism


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:14:48 - 02:16:05)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3fc2951d-099b-4bb2-b07d-13c2e6ebf3e8)




### ‚ú® Summary
Eating the same meal in the morning rather than at night results in significantly lower glucose and insulin responses, indicating better metabolic efficiency. Early meals align with our active diurnal phase, enhancing absorption and processing of nutrients. In contrast, nighttime eating may coincide with increased melatonin production, which can temporarily impair insulin sensitivity, leading to less effective glucose utilization. Thus, prioritizing earlier meal times and adopting a lower carbohydrate intake throughout the day can optimize metabolic health and reduce glucose spikes.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I'll mention one other piece of data that I think is actually really kind of fun as well with timing of eating. There was a study that looked at people who ate the exact same meal at 9.30 a.m. Or 8.30 p.m. So basically after dark, essentially in the part of the diurnal phase, we probably shouldn't be eating versus early in the morning, 9.30. And the glucose and insulin responses for the same meal at 8.30 p.m. Were significantly higher than when eating at 9.30 a.m. And so again, bang for your buck. It appears that eating in that earlier part of the day when we're active and our chronobiology is set up for metabolism and activity, we have a lower glucose and insulin response. There's also some evidence that melatonin, which is secreted, you know, as we get closer to sleep, has somewhat of an effect on impairing our insulin sensitivity transiently. And so we may actually just be not absorbing the glucose from those meals effectively later at night. So I tend to kind of move a little bit more, a little bit more low carb, I would say throughout the day based on that data and what I've seen on my continuous glucose monitor, basically just Higher spikes for the same meal later in the day. So why not just kind of move it up earlier?</blockquote>

### [02:20:27] Fiber and Fat: The Dynamic Duo for Glucose Control


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:19:33 - 02:20:32)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d7cbad12-419b-4761-b1ad-114c6decf859)




### ‚ú® Summary
Incorporating fat and fiber into meals significantly reduces glucose response, as demonstrated by data from various studies. Fat slows gastric emptying, leading to a more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream. Additionally, fiber creates a barrier that limits glucose absorption, effectively preventing the complete uptake of carbohydrates. A robust correlation exists between fiber intake and reduced glucose excursions, highlighting fiber's ease of incorporation into meals as a practical dietary strategy for better glucose management.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, I mean, a lot of the things that you just naturally learned are the things that have been shown in data. And like you said, some of this data, it's like small studies, small groups of people. But for instance, adding fat and fiber to meals has a significant and repeatable impact in populations on lowering glucose response. Fat probably in some part due to slowing gastric emptying and actually slowing the digesting process. So the rise in the bloodstream is going to slow down and then fiber both for that reason, but also because fiber can in a sense create like a mesh sort of blocking the absorption of some Of the glucose that's in the meal. So literally kind of actually preventing you from absorbing all of the carbs. And we've actually seen that in the levels data set that the more fiber people include with their meals, we see essentially a direct relationship with lowering of their glucose excursions, Which is really exciting because fiber is something that you can add to meals very easily.</blockquote>

### [02:23:52] Monitor Glucose Dynamics for Early Insulin Resistance Detection


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:22:31 - 02:23:53)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/acd6590d-1921-4ca0-8ddc-6a3ef55756da)




### ‚ú® Summary
Trends in post-meal glucose response are crucial for early prediction of metabolic diseases. A healthy, insulin-sensitive individual typically experiences a rapid spike in glucose about 45 minutes after a meal, followed by a return to baseline levels within 90 minutes to two hours. If glucose levels linger and take longer than two hours to decrease, this may indicate early signs of insulin resistance, suggesting the body struggles to clear glucose efficiently. Recognizing these patterns is not yet standard practice but could provide valuable insights into metabolic health.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you can see trends over time, which I think is very valuable. And then that's fascinating in terms of early prediction of metabolic disease is that you can see how long it takes your glucose to come down after a meal. So in a normal, healthy insulin sensitive body, even if the glucose goes way up, it should come way down very quickly because the insulin is binded to insulin receptors and the glucose Is getting taken up and it'll lower. What is quickly over the course? It should be down by two hours, but from what I've actually seen in our like most insulin sensitive people and also in research that looks at young, healthy populations, you should basically Be spiking and coming down, spike about 45 minutes and come down hour and a half, 90 minutes to two hours. But if this is after sorry, after last bite, after last bite, although it's hard to kind of exactly know, but yeah, meal is over. I would say about 45 minutes to go up to the peak and then start coming down very quickly. Now, if you start to see that glucose is going up and then trailing very slowly back down to normal, maybe taking more than two hours, three hours, that is going to be one of those early Indicators of potential insulin resistance. Your body's not clearing the glucose, but that's not a metric that we use in standard practice at all. And I've actually seen myself very insulin sensitive.</blockquote>

### [02:26:16] Glycemic Variability Reveals Hidden Health Risks


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:24:59 - 02:26:17)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebdba7e0-b477-47fe-b354-0eb82fe70609)




### ‚ú® Summary
A landmark study utilizing continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) on non-diabetic individuals revealed significant variations in glycemic patterns, categorizing individuals into low, moderately spiky, and very spiky groups. The research indicated that higher glycemic variability correlates with worse metabolic biomarkers, such as insulin and triglycerides, suggesting underlying health dysfunctions that standard diabetes tests would overlook. Some participants demonstrated glucose levels indicating pre-diabetes or diabetes, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring to identify at-risk individuals who might be misdiagnosed as healthy by traditional medical criteria.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Totally landmark study. But basically they put continuous glucose monitors on non-diabetic individuals who by standard criteria of diabetes do not have diabetes. And he showed that on a CGM, a continuous glucose monitor, you have these low variability people that are pretty much flat throughout the day with little teeny, little teeny rolling Hills after their meals. You have moderately spiky people. And then you have very spiky people who are going up, down, up, down, up, down. When you correlate those different patterns of glycemic variability in non-diabetic people, you find that the spikier they are, the worse their biomarkers are, metabolically across The board, insulin, triglycerides, et cetera. So basically they're showing signs through variability of underlying dysfunction that you would never know from a standard test. Those are the people who I imagine are probably going to go on to develop diseases. And yet, based on standard criteria, they're doctors telling them that they're fine, that they're all the same. So he also showed in that study that non-diabetic individuals, when you have a CGM on, are going into the diabetic range and the pre-diabetic range, a fairly significant amount. And we would never know that if you weren't actually tracking a movie of the glucose. So that's the glycemic variability, area under the curve. Those are two things.</blockquote>

### [02:28:00] Cortisol and Insulin Resistance: A Morning Gauge


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:26:39 - 02:28:02)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/18c818fb-216b-410f-9717-2a752c04b091)




### ‚ú® Summary
The cortisol awakening response triggers a release of glucose from the liver to prepare the body for the day, acting as a stress hormone. Research indicates that the intensity of this Dawn Effect is linked to levels of insulin resistance; a more pronounced response may indicate higher stress or excessive cortisol. Ideally, a rise of less than 10 points upon waking is acceptable, while increases of 20 to 40 points suggest concerns, especially if insulin is not effectively managing glucose uptake. Caffeine can exacerbate this response by further elevating cortisol levels, serving as an important factor in understanding one's metabolic health.

#### üìö Transcript

<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What's happening here is that the cortisol awakening response to actually get you to wake up and get out of bed, that cortisol can cause you to dump a bunch of glucose from your liver because It's basically saying stress hormone, cortisol, we got to get up, we need glucose to fuel the muscles, let's dump a little glucose. So it's normal. But what the research shows is that magnitude of Dawn Effect is correlated with insulin resistance. So the more the Dawn Effect you're getting, I think it can signal maybe the more stress you're under, the more cortisol you have floating around, how big your cortisol awakening response Is. But also if you imagine if you're dumping all that glucose from your liver and your cells aren't taking it up well because you're insulin resistant, that response, that Dawn Effect Is going to be higher. So I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but typically I would want to see a Dawn Effect, I think of like less than 10 points. So you wake up and you may very well see a rise. This is absence of any food yet. And you do not want to see that going up 20, 30, 40 points. Some people see a little bump again with caffeine in the morning because it's more cortisol. And so that's another thing that standard stuff would never tell you. So those are kind of some of the looking at early predictors of metabolic dysfunction. More of the fun stuff is like actually just figuring out like how is food affecting your body.</blockquote>

### [02:30:44] Personalized Nutrition: Individual Responses Matter

### ‚ú® Summary
Understanding personalized glycemic responses is crucial for dietary health, as individuals can react differently to the same foods, such as blueberries, leading to varying glucose levels. The traditional glycemic index concept is challenged by this variability, highlighting the importance of managing glycemic stability over time. Sustainable strategies like improved sleep, post-meal walking, resistance training, and breathwork can effectively moderate glucose spikes. These tailored lifestyle choices enable better management of glucose levels and promote overall health.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so it's, it's really helping with, um, what are the sneaky spikers and then where's the biochemical individuality? And there was a phenomenal paper out of, um, uh, um, Israel that from, from Sal about seven years ago called personalized nutrition by prediction of glycemic responses. It made big waves, but it basically showed that you and I could eat the same handful of blueberries and have totally different glycemic responses. So the idea of glycemic index as like a certain amount of food with a certain amount of glucose causes a certain glucose rise, it kind of debunked that. And that matters because repeated sustained glycemic variability over time is not good for our health. We want to choose the foods or balance the foods that are going to keep us relatively more stable. Um, so that that's, that's very helpful. Just understanding your personal response to food. And then what are the lifestyle strategies you can use sleeping better, walking after meals, more resistance training, cold plunging, breath work that can actually serve to modulate The food environment to actually reduce the glucose spikes. And people find that all of those things can positively impact glucose spikes, especially the walks after the meals.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) track glucose fluctuations not only around meal times but also show long-term effects, such as those caused by sleep conditions. Studies indicate that exposure to bright or even dim light during sleep can significantly affect morning blood glucose levels, highlighting the interplay between environmental factors, sleep quality, and metabolic health. This insight underscores the importance of optimizing sleep conditions to support better glucose management.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's interesting. The CGM's can reveal things not just in the immediate meal period but can relate to sort of downstream consequences. Yeah, again, I found it to be tremendously useful. I'm so glad you mentioned sleep by the way. I'm going to resist the temptation to rattle off 20 studies showing that even having too much bright light in a room while one is sleeping at night, even dim light, which is, you know, I don't want to scare people into thinking they have to sleep in complete darkness. Although an eye mask can be great, can alter morning blood glucose levels. I believe it was adults and kids as well. It's a study in proceeds in the National Academy of Sciences. I have to go back and check if it included kids. But pretty striking. And then there's something very clear about the fact that when people get the early night</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Perplexy excels in interpreting poorly constructed queries, emphasizing the importance of product design that accommodates laziness. While some argue for clearer sentences to promote thinking, the magic of a product lies in enabling users to be lazier. A balance can be struck by allowing users to focus on clicking and choosing related content rather than solely on constructing precise queries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, one of the things that Perplexy's clearly really good at is figuring out what I meant from a poorly constructed query.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and I don't even need you to type in a query. You can just type in a bunch of words, it should be okay. Like that's the extent to which you gotta design the product because people are lazy and a better product should be one that allows you to be more lazy, not less. Sure, there is some, like the other side of the argument is to say, you know, if you ask people to type in clearer sentences, it forces them to think, and that's a good thing too. But at the end, like, products need to be having some magic to them and the magic comes from letting you be more lazy.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, right, it's a trade off but one of the things you could ask people to do in terms of work is the clicking, choosing the next related stuff in their journey.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In AI development, it is challenging to create new signals without human annotation. While tasks such as math and coding can be verified using traditional methods, open-ended tasks like predicting the stock market for Q3 pose challenges. One approach is to use historical data, train on signals from previous quarters, and gradually collect diverse tasks to create a reinforcement learning system. Completion of tasks is typically verified by humans based on whether the task was achieved.

You don't even know. Okay, maybe you can use historic data. I only give you data until Q1, and see if you predict it for Q2, and you train on that signal. Maybe that's useful. And then you still have to collect a bunch of tasks like that and create a RL suit for that. Give agents tasks like a browser and ask them to do things. And sandbox it. And completion is based on whether the task was achieved, which will be verified by humans.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Efficiency in winning the AGI race lies in decoupling reasoning and facts to create smaller models capable of efficient reasoning, eliminating the need for large clusters. Representing knowledge in a more efficient and abstract manner enables iterative reasoning that is parameter decoupled, offering a way to disrupt the current compute-dependent trend in AI development.

### ‚ú® Summary
Traditional wisdom like determination and grit are crucial for starting a company. It's essential to be passionate about an idea rather than solely focusing on what the market demands to attract funding or customers. Working on something not truly important to you can lead to burnout and lack of motivation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think all the traditional wisdom applies. I'm not gonna say none of that matters. Relentless determination, grit. Believing in yourself and others don't, all these things matter. So if you don't have these traits, I think it's definitely hard to do a company. But you deciding to do a company despite all this clearly means you have it or you think you have it, either way you can fake it till you have it. I think the thing that most people get wrong after they've decided to start a company is work on things they the market wants. Like, not being passionate about any idea, but thinking, okay, look, this is what will get me venture funding. This is what will get me revenue or customers. That's what will get me venture funding. If you work from that perspective, I think you'll give beyond the point because it's very hard to work towards something that was not truly important to you. Do you really care? We work on search. I really obsess about search even before starting Perplexity. My co -founder Dennis worked first job was at Bing. And then my co -founders Dennis and Johnny worked at Quora together and</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
For over a century, the United States has been at the forefront of global economic, technological, and military advancements. Despite criticisms, it has played a crucial role in maintaining unprecedented global peace for the last 70 years. However, the current state of peace and prosperity is not to be taken for granted, as it was not always the case, and the world used to be more divided and volatile.

### ‚ú® Summary
Blockchain technology allows individuals to bypass traditional industry gatekeepers and directly publish their ideas on the internet, reducing the power held by big companies over data and information. This decentralization of power from tech giants like Google benefits individuals by providing more control over their businesses, artistic content, and economic transactions. Blockchain technology offers a solution to the high concentration of power and information control held by a few dominant companies, empowering individuals to operate without being subject to the limitations imposed by these tech giants.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Everybody gets to participate and there's no big industry that you have to go through. You can go do your thing. If you've got talent or ideas or whatever, you can publish your ideas, you can write and put it on the internet. You don't have to get a job at the New York Times and all that kind of thing. Was that the history of technology is kind of the history of networks and servers. And the servers ended up being owned by big companies and there were a lot of technological architectural reasons for that. And so the winning companies ended up owning all your data in kind of the discovery layer with Google or in the social networking layer or in the commerce layer. And so as a result, these companies became massively powerful, like more powerful than most governments like Google, I think we would all agree is more powerful than probably 95% of The countries in the world in terms of who controls the information, how much money they have, everything. And that's kind of ends up being to the detriment the people to have that high concentration of power in several ways. One, like to build a business you're now beholden to them and they can eliminate your business by just making you impossible to find. If you're an artist, you know, the take rates for your work on, you know, if you're on Instagram or if you're on TikTok or whatever, or really onerous, like you put up the content and they Get 99% of the money. Like there's no other thing in the world. And even, you know, with something like Apple, like you build an application, they get 30% of the money. It's just, you know, a very constant, high concentration of economic power information control etc. And we haven't had a technology to deal with that but now we do with blockchain so it's amazing breakthrough.</blockquote>

### [01:32:36] Creative Destruction vs. Bureaucratic Stagnation


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:30:57 - 01:32:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/305bae5b-35bc-45cf-a8b9-71f95f52c400)




### ‚ú® Summary
Capitalism thrives on creative destruction, where innovation from startups leads to prosperity and enables older companies to adapt or fade away. This process fosters continuous renewal through the emergence of new ideas and businesses. In contrast, the political system tends to resist change, leading to a buildup of bureaucracy without the capacity for renewal. Instead of evolving, it grows larger and more complex, lacking the mechanisms for constructive reform. This unchecked growth in government poses a threat to the dynamism essential for economic success, suggesting that voters may soon need to confront the need for substantial change to preserve the principles that support prosperity.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I mean, look, if we're talking about capitalism, I think about what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter said, which is capitalism is a process of creative destruction. And the creativity happens in the early days when you've got a founder who's creating a startup and the business gets big, but then it gets older and the founder goes away and the company Can drift and become bureaucratic. And sometimes it can renew itself. And maybe you get a Brian Nicolan maybe to save it, and sometimes it doesn't. And the companies that get old and don't renew themselves eventually fade away, and they get destroyed and replaced by other startups. It's a system that has worked incredibly well in America, and that's the basis for all of our prosperity and innovation. When you compare that to the political process, it's very different. I mean, the political process kind of has this knee-jerk resistance to change and innovation, and it has an impulse to control things. It wants to control prices. It thinks it can solve problems with just top-down mandates. And it doesn't reform itself. It creates new bureaucracies. It never gets rid of them. I mean, we create new departments. They never go away, they just keep getting bigger and bigger. There's never any creative destruction. It's just like a... It's a one-way ratchet of bureaucratic growth. So it's really clear what creates prosperity. And I do think we have now reached a point where the government has gotten so big and so out of control and so expensive it actually is threatening this engine of creative destruction.

### ‚ú® Summary
The political process exhibits a resistance to change and innovation, driven by a compulsion to control through top-down mandates, which leads to the expansion of bureaucracies without the elimination of obsolete structures. This unchecked growth of government threatens the dynamics of creative destruction essential for prosperity. A crucial decision lies ahead for voters, where they must choose between reining in government expansion to foster capitalist innovation or allowing it to dominate and stifle economic progress. The contrast between capitalism and socialism underscores the importance of managing the distribution of power and resources efficiently.

### [12:43] TikTok's Dopamine Hit and Behavior Response Loop


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (11:10 - 12:49)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f80d0ce7-4ae9-4973-91f1-e016f50c0d6b)




### ‚ú® Summary
The popularity of TikTok among young individuals stems from its ability to provide quick dopamine rewards, unlike traditional storytelling mediums like television. TikTok optimizes for activities that trigger dopamine release, creating a behavior response loop that keeps users engaged. This approach, focused on variable rewards, aligns with human evolutionary biology and taps into our innate wiring for seeking immediate gratification.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, yeah. So stories are great. There's no problem with stories, no problem with Netflix. And then I say, how many of you use TikTok or one of those programs at least once a week? The great, not everybody, but the great majority of hands go up. How many of you wish that it was never invented the great majority of hands go up? And what's happening to the, and these are 19 year old, they're smart kids, they're, you know, they're mostly sophomores at New York university, Stern school of business. But these things aren't stories. A story is entertaining, but it doesn't give you a huge hit of dopamine. It's, it's, it's, if it's really well told, it can be an aesthetic experience, you lose yourself, but it's not about the quick dopamine reward system. Whereas TikTok and that short form, it's able to optimize for whatever gives you that little bit of dopamine in your reinforcement pathways. And because there's a behavior response loop, which you didn't have with television, with television, you could raise the volume, lower the volume, or change the channel. That's it. Those were your options. There was not like a feedback loop where the television is rewarding you for certain actions. Whereas what TikTok pioneered is we don't care who you know, we only care what makes you pause, what makes you click, what makes you react. So, TikTok is basically if BF Skinner could come back to life, you know, one of the founders of behaviorism, and observe TikTok, he'd say this is brilliant. This is so brilliant.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, variable rewards. Yeah, exactly.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Can you just hit on why, from an evolutionary biology perspective, we are wired this way.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That is a great way to put it. I'm going to take that line and try to remember to credit you for it. Watching the funniest thing. Okay. Watching the funniest thing. That's great. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And so can you blame them? Right? It was kind of like... This is my point about like instant access.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I've always had this belief that the Zen Buddhists got it right. They always had it right. There are two key aspects of human nature, that if you can address those, you solve all the world's problems, which is desire and dualism, dualistic thinking.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Tell me what do you mean If you solve those two things, so desire, yes, Buddha's all about cutting off desire.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>And the aspect of desire that plays out in this context is, I, at any given moment now, have access or can see, can create a desire for something that I would, if I was sitting in a village Without a phone, I wouldn't have a desire to be on a private jet. But now I'm sitting on this phone, I'm seeing this funniest moment or this most beautiful person, or this incredible experience that I am not a part of, I am not in I don't get instant desire Creation for me. So the dopamine aspect, I also question as anticipatory, because I think I don't know if it was your book or some other research I've read about being released in anticipation, not necessarily In the satisfaction of acquisition, that the acquisition of something always feels a little bit, okay, I got it. Whereas the moment right before you get it, is when you get the best opening it like that, that anticipation is really it is the experience of taking a scoop of ice cream.</blockquote>

### [30:58] Foundational Norms for Healthy Screen Use

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker proposed four foundational norms for healthy screen use amongst children: no smartphone before high school, no social media until 16, phone-free schools, and encouraging more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world. By implementing these norms, the speaker believes that children can break out of the collective action problems caused by excessive screen time.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But I really wrote the book, assuming there's not gonna be a legislative solution to this. We have to do this ourselves by changing norms. And so in the book I propose, I mean, I have like 50 suggestions, 50 ideas for parents and teachers in schools, but I realized, wait, four of these are just really foundational things That we can do together and they're really powerful. So in order, they are no smartphone before high school. We have just cleared this all out middle school. Middle schoolers should not be having the internet in their pocket, give them a flip phone, give them a phone watch, give them something else, but not a smartphone. No social media till 16. Social media is wildly inappropriate for minors. It's full of extreme sex, violence, you know, men from all over the world reaching out to you because they want sex. I mean, it's insane that we have children talking with men all over the world. So no social media til 16. The third norm is phone free schools. Lock up the phones in a yonder pouch, or in a phone locker in the morning, they get it back at the end of the day. And the fourth norm is far more independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. Because until the 1990s, kids had a childhood, they were outside a lot, they had adventures, they to be self -governing, self -supervising. We took that away from them beginning in the 90s, totally gone by 2015. So our kids never get any fun or adventure. So all they have is their screens. So if we do those four things, we break out of these collective action problems.</blockquote>

### [40:55] Identifying Harmful Untruths and Distortions in Society

### ‚ú® Summary
The three harmful untruths outlined are to avoid stress and always trust feelings, life is a battle between good and evil, and what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. These beliefs can lead to depression and anxiety. The distortion of viewing life as a battle between good and evil causes significant human misery by dividing people into 'us versus them' mentality where one side is seen as completely bad and the other is seen as completely good.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>No, good. No, that's right. And that's another point of continuity from the coddling. So the the central idea of the coddling was that there are three great untruths ideas that are so bad, that if any young person believes all three, they're almost certain to be depressed, Anxious, not amount too much in life. And those three are what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. So avoid stressful experiences, avoid speakers who are going to say things that you hate, don't expose yourself. Always trust your feelings, your feelings are right if you feel offended by something someone has offended you. And someone has to do something about this, someone has to punish that person. And the third, to your point about duality, is life is a battle between good people and evil people. And this is the distortion that's caused the most human misery. I mean, this is a normal thing people do. This is part of being a tribal species. We're very, very good at coming together to say our side has been hurt or cheated or defiled by their side. They're the evil ones. They're perfectly bad. We're perfectly good. So it's that third distortion is really the most pernicious from a societal level. Now, what you just said before about the haves and the have -nots, that's what the left used to be about from the time of Marx or the French Revolution even until the 1950s or 60s.</blockquote>

### [50:21] Balance between Progress and Stability in Society

### ‚ú® Summary
Personality traits such as openness to experience and conscientiousness influence whether individuals lean towards progressivism or conservatism. Progressives advocate for change and improvement in institutions, inspired by the idea of 'dreaming of things that never were'. They want to challenge the status quo to create a more just society. Conversely, conservatives emphasize caution and the preservation of existing institutions, warning against hasty changes that may lead to negative consequences. A balanced society requires a mix of both perspectives, akin to having a car with a gas pedal for progress and a brake for stability.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I'll answer your question as a psychologist, which is one of the amazing discoveries in psychology since the 80s is that almost everything about our personality is partly heritable. And if you have an identical twin separated at birth, you never met. But if you're very much on the left, your twin probably is too. Something about our brains make us predisposed to the right or the left. And it goes back to openness to experience and conscientiousness of you personality traits. But basically, there's a there's a liberal or progressive sentiment that says it's captured by this Robert F. Kennedy quote, some men see things as they are and say why I dream things that never were, and say why not? So progressives historically are the people who look at existing institutions and say, you know, why don't we change this? Like why don't we have some other thing, which might be more just? So progressives are always pushing for progress, for change. But then the wisdom of the right is to say, you know what, we may not understand our institutions, but if we just go changing them willy -nilly, it's going to be a disaster because we don't Understand what we're doing. In fact, I opened our conversation with that. That's actually a conservative, but one thing I learned from reading the conservative intellectuals, going back to Edmund Burke, you can't just go messing with institutions and Expect it to work out well. So a good liberal democracy, one in which you have some people pushing for change, you've got other people saying slow down, like not so fast, like let's be careful about this. And that's William F. Buckley's famous quote about a national review is going to stand to thwart history yelling stop or at least slow down. So that's great. Like you have a car with a gas pedal and a brake, like you need that.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The emergence of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook has resulted in empowering the far left and far right extremes, while silencing the voices of the center left and center right. Instead of giving more voice to the disempowered, social media has created a Roman Colosseum-like environment where extremes thrive and moderate voices are drowned out, leading to a real disaster for the country.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is Thomas Sowell talking about the constrained vision of humanity. So that's all healthy. And then you always have some far left radicals who they become Maoist in one generation, they become Robespierre in another generation, they chop off heads, prone to violence on the Left you got a group prone to violence on the far right that are reactionary that are authoritarian and Let's say there was some distribution now then along comes Twitter along comes Facebook along comes social media. What happens? Mark Zuckerberg used to say how could it be wrong to give more people more voice? That sounds great But what if you're not giving the disempowered more voice? What if you're not giving everyone voice? What if you're bringing everyone into the Roman Colosseum and saying, okay, let's fight it out for the bit for the entertainment of the people in the stands. And the great majority of people don't want to fight with swords. They just go quiet. And some people pick up the swords like, yes, let's go. And so the far left becomes super empowered, the far right becomes super empowered, and the center left and the center right goes silent. And that's what I think is, you know, that's, I think, a real disaster for our country.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I think that was like such an excellent, like commentary for people to hear. I want to ask one on which is why has liberalism and conservatism in some aspects switched?</blockquote>

The speaker condemns the regime for degrading women, with allegations that the former president of Iran endorsed the rape of young girls to prevent them from going to heaven.

Qasem Soleimani, Javad Zarif, these are like the reformists and heroes of the Iranian people because they don't want to be other Syria. They don't want to be other Iraq. And that's the narrative of the Islamic lobbyists outside Iran. But guess what? This is the Islamic Republic turning Iran to another Syria. This is the murderous regime of my beloved homeland, turning the whole country like a chaos. It would be like a prison break. Iranians are hostages right now.

1. Trump lacks ideological goals and grand ambitions beyond self-aggrandizement, making him less dangerous than Hitler.
2. Despite Trump's narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies, his lack of ideological drive is a significant distinction from historical figures like Hitler.
3. Trump's comedic charisma and entertaining presentation can distract people from his character flaws and unsuitability for leadership.
4. Putting someone like Trump, consumed by personal vanity and avarice, in power is deemed highly problematic and a black hole of selfishness.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker believes Trump is not comparable to Hitler because Trump lacks ideological goals and grand ambitions beyond self-aggrandizement. Despite Trump's narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies, his lack of ideological drive makes him a smaller and less dangerous figure than Hitler. However, the speaker highlights that Trump's comedic charisma and entertaining presentation distract people from his character flaws and unsuitability for leadership. Putting someone like Trump, consumed by personal vanity and avarice, in power is deemed highly problematic and a black hole of selfishness.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I don't think Trump is Hitler. And, you know, you can tell me if you disagree. But I think there's a big difference in the fact that he's not ideological and he has no apparent grand ambitions beyond anything other than his own self -aggrandizement. So he's a much smaller figure and far less dangerous in my mind, even at his worst, than someone like Hitler. But he has this kind of comedic charisma that causes many people simply not to see or seen, not to care what an aberrant person he is, and psychologically and ethically, and just how his Personal vanity, how his personal avarice is just absolutely the wrong thing to put in power in this country. We can talk about the implications of that, but I just wanted to first broach this issue of just the way he presents makes it very easy for people who you would think would be allergic to Him and who would see the downside of having this malignantly narcissistic, arguably sociopathic personality. He is just a black hole of selfishness. The idea that you would put him in power and that it would just be a good time because he's such a entertainer, this is the first obstacle. People are just busy being entertained by him.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it's funny, I'm doing this from memory, but as I remember that essay ends</blockquote>

> Gabor Steingart pr√§sentiert das Pioneer Briefing<br/>>  Deutschland gilt wegen seiner schwachen Wirtschaft inzwischen als kranker Mann Europas. Doch was sind die Ursachen? Fehlt es an Investitionen oder an Innovationen, sind immer noch die Folgen der gestiegenen Energiepreise schuld oder vor allem der Fachkr√§ftemangel? Welche Rolle spielt die B√ºrokratie und warum ist der  Inflation Reduction Act  der Biden-Regierung eigentlich so viel wirkungsvoller als der europ√§ische  Green Deal ? All das analysiert im Gespr√§ch mit  Gabor Steingart  ein Mann, der sich bestens auskennt mit der Wirtschaft:  Joe Kaeser .

### ‚ú® Summary
Die Marktwirtschaft und insbesondere die Wirtschaftsentwicklung sollten priorisiert werden, da die Einnahmen aus der Wirtschaft die Grundlage f√ºr soziale Sicherung und eine nachhaltige Wirtschaft bilden. Steuern sind ein Produkt der wirtschaftlichen Leistungsf√§higkeit und erm√∂glichen Investitionen in soziale Sicherungssysteme. Eine Umdenken hin zur Betonung der Rolle der Wirtschaft als Mittelherkunft f√ºr staatliche Ausgaben ist erforderlich, anstatt sich ausschlie√ülich auf soziale Unterst√ºtzung zu konzentrieren, da nur eine starke Wirtschaft langfristig Wohlstand erm√∂glicht.

Und ich denke, wir in Deutschland tun gut daran, uns nochmal darauf zu besinnen, dass die Wirtschaft, die Marktwirtschaft ja die Mittelherkunft an sich auch ist. Dass das, was dort verdient wird, was investiert wird, dann auch in die soziale Sicherung und nat√ºrlich auch in eine nachhaltige Wirtschaft hineingesteckt werden kann. Aber das ist die Reihenfolge. Man kann... Wirtschaft zuerst, sagen Sie. Ja, genau, weil man immer nur das ausgeben kann, was man vorher verdient hat. Die Steuern sind ein Substrat dessen. Die Steuern sind im Grunde ein Ausdruck der Mittelherkunft. Wenn es der Wirtschaft gut geht, dann gibt es viele Steuern. Und dann kann man auch viel investieren, aber auch eine gute soziale Sicherung betreiben. Aber die Reihenfolge ist im Augenblick nicht so.

### [02:45] Challenges of Transitioning into Government


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:21 - 02:49)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f196fdd7-b11e-4ac6-9fdc-8b370d0522d8)




### ‚ú® Summary
Transitioning into a governmental role requires an individual to shift focus from mere rhetoric to action, emphasizing skills such as focus, prioritization, policy-making, and team-building. The biggest challenge lies in navigating through a system accustomed to inertia, where the government apparatus tends to resist change and believes in its permanence, making it difficult for elected officials to drive meaningful transformation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And, you know, those executive skills, which are about focus, prioritization, good policy, building the right team of people who can actually help you govern, because the moment You become the government, you end up leaving aside the saying becomes less important than the doing. Whereas when you're in you're running for office, it's all about saying. So all of these things mean that it's a much more difficult, much more focused and, you know, it's suddenly you're thrust into this completely new environment when you come in. And that's what makes it, that's the hardest thing. And then of course, you know, you do have a situation in which the system, as a system, it's not that it's a, I'm not a believer that this is great deep state theory, we can talk about that, But that's not the problem with government. The problem with government is that it's not a conspiracy, either left wing or right wing. It's a conspiracy for inertia. The thing about government systems is that they always think we're permanent. You've come in as the elected politician. You're temporary. And we know how to do this. And if you only just let us alone, we would carry on managing the status quo in the right way. And so that's the toughest thing. It's making that transition.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>OK, so that's really interesting.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Politics involves attacking opponents but policy-making requires intellectual exercise. Turning ambitions into policies is challenging as it requires understanding complex issues like the AI revolution. Political leaders need to work hard to formulate the right policies to leverage opportunities, mitigate risks, and regulate new technologies.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The problem comes with the second challenge, which is that though politics at one level, is It, attacking your opponents, it's quite a crude business. When it comes to policy, it's really intellectual business politics. That's why people often, if they've only got ambitions, then they haven't really undertaken the intellectual exercise to turn those into policies. Policies are hard. It's hard to work out what the right policy is. If you take this AI revolution, and I think we're living through a period of massive change, right, this is the biggest technological change since the Industrial Revolution, for sure. For political leaders today to understand that, to work out what the right policy is, to access the opportunities, mitigate the risks, regulate it, this is really difficult work. And so what happens a lot of the time, is that people are elected on the basis they are change makers, because they've articulated a general vision for change. But when you then come to, okay, what does that really mean in specific terms? That's where the hard work hasn't been done.</blockquote>

### [33:14] Leadership Determines Governance and Success

### ‚ú® Summary
The quality of governance, heavily influenced by leadership, is a key determinant of a country's success. Good leadership can lead to successful outcomes even with limited resources, opportunities, or historical challenges, while poor leadership can lead to failure. Examples such as Poland and Ukraine, Rwanda and Burundi, and North and South Korea demonstrate how leadership plays a crucial role in shaping the trajectory and success of a nation. While other factors may come into play, leadership remains a critical factor in determining the quality of governance and ultimately the success of a country.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I think, I mean, the whole reason I started this institute was because I think the quality of governance of which the leadership is a big part, I think it is the determinant. In today's world where capital's mobile, technology's mobile, any country with good leadership, it can make a success. You can take two countries side by side, same resources, same opportunities, same potential therefore. Once it sees, one fails. If you look at it, it's always about the quality of decision making. If you take, for example, before the Ukraine War, if you take Poland and Ukraine, when both came out of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, I think people would have given Ukraine as much Chance as Poland of doing well. Poland today is doing really well. Why is that? Because they joined the European Union, they've had to make huge changes and reforms, and therefore they're a successful country. You look at Rwanda and Burundi. It was Rwanda that suffered the genocide. But Rwanda today, I mean, it's one of the most respected countries in Africa. And then you look at the Korean Peninsula, which is the biggest experiment in human governance has ever been, North Korea and South Korea. South Korea had the same GDP per head as Sierra Leone in the 1960s. And now it's one of the top countries in the world.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And you think that's fundamentally a question of who the leadership was, like Park in South Korea, or there are other factors that are obviously different between these countries, Right? And also you mentioned leadership determines governance. But I guess if you look at a system like the united states or the uk we've had good and bad leaders fundamentally the quality of the governance doesn't seem to shift that much between who The leader is is the is a quality of governance sort of in the quality institutions.</blockquote>

### [40:53] Overcoming Resistance and Distractions for Change

### ‚ú® Summary
Change is difficult due to resistance from vested interests and distractions. People often encounter resistance when proposing reforms, facing challenges during implementation, and hindsight wishing for more change. Vested interests sometimes hinder progress, like countries using heavy fuel oil despite abundant renewable energy sources. Government distractions like events, crises, and scandals can derail efforts from focusing on core tasks. It is common for leaders to spend minimal time on priorities, hindering success.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Happens usually for two reasons. And number one, it's really hard to make change. You know, I what I learned about making change is that there's a certain rhythm to it. You know, when you first propose a reform, people tell you it's a terrible idea. When you're doing it, it's absolute hell. And after you've done it, you wish you'd done more of it. And you know, that is, so sometimes people just find the system too resistant, there might be vested interests that get in the way of it. I mean, I sometimes come across countries that are island states with warm weather, but they get all their, their electricity from heavy fuel oil, you know, when they've got limitless Amounts of solar and wind that they could be using, but it's vested interest. The other thing is, I sometimes say it's the government is a conspiracy of distraction. Because you've got events and crises and scandals. And the most difficult thing is to keep focused when you've got so many things that are diverting you from that core task. And what often happens with leaders, you know, sometimes what we do with our leaders is we say to them, okay, we're going to do an analysis of here are your priorities, here's how much Time you spend on them. And you end up with people spending 4% of their time on their priorities. And you say, well, no wonder you're not succeeding.</blockquote>

### [52:23] Key Principles for Political Success and the Influence of Technology

### ‚ú® Summary
In politics, it is crucial to avoid declaring a favorite leader to prevent making many enemies. Successful countries share common traits such as stable macroeconomic policies, enabling business environments, upholding the rule of law, and providing quality education. These factors contribute to success, while their absence can lead to failure. Country leaders must adapt to the changing landscape driven by technology, engaging with the revolution, involving knowledgeable individuals in decision-making, and making choices to capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You see, George, one of the things you must never ever do in politics is say who's your favorite leader, who's done well, because you will make one friend and many, many enemies. So I'm just going to answer it in this way, that if you look at the countries that have succeeded today, if you look, for example, as any country that was third world become first world, Was second world become first world, there are certain things that stand out and are clear. Number one, they have stable macroeconomic policy. Number two, they allow business and enterprise to flourish. Number three, they have the rule of law. Number four, they educate their people well. And wherever you look around the world and you see those things in place, you will find success. And whenever you find their absence, you will find either the fact or the possibility of failure. The one thing, however, that any country leader should focus on today is the possibility of all of these rules being rewritten by the importance of technology. The single most important thing today, if I was back in the front line of politics, would be, as I say, to engage with this revolution, to understand it, to bring in the people into the Discussions and the councils of government who also get it, and to take the key decisions that will allow us to access the opportunities and mitigate the risks.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. True happiness does not come from external factors like success or accolades, but from understanding what genuinely brings contentment.
2. Hedonic adaptation causes us to stop appreciating even the best moments in life, leading to a decrease in happiness over time.
3. Subjective measurement of happiness through self-report scales is a valid scientific method.
4. Engaging in flow-inducing activities can enhance leisure experiences and bring about a cathartic feeling.
5. Time allocation, not just discretionary income, and loss aversion are important considerations for overall happiness.

### [06:13] Chasing the Wrong Things for Happiness


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (04:59 - 06:13)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b65097a4-43b3-49b6-be62-d9a690dc712e)




### ‚ú® Summary
The key insight is that despite putting significant effort into achieving things we believe will bring happiness, such as success or accolades, lasting happiness does not stem from these external factors. Studies show that while achieving these goals may result in temporary happiness, it is short-lived. True happiness comes from understanding that our minds often deceive us about what truly brings contentment, and it requires deliberate effort to identify what genuinely makes us feel good in the long term.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, I think it's important to start with this idea that we put so much effort in, right? Because I think you could sometimes think about happiness of like, oh, we're all not feeling so happy. And that's because we're not trying. Like, we need to try more. And I think that's not the problem. I think people are putting tremendous energy into the kinds of things that they think are going to make them feel good, feel successful, you know, lead to a meaningful life. But then even though we're putting in this much effort, we're kind of not getting anywhere. And I think the issue is that our minds, the way I like to talk about on the podcast is that our minds lie to us about the kinds of things that make us happy. We have these strong intuitions that, you know, if this would happen, I would be happily ever after, right? You know, if like I have the perfect job or if I get a higher salary or if I get a certain accolade at work, if I become partner or for my students, if I get, you know, perfect grades, like, People think if those things happen that they'll feel happier. And, you know, there's studies that look at people who get those wonderful things. And yeah, you get a little happiness boost for a little while, but it doesn't seem to last. Lasting happiness comes from something else. And so, yeah, so the problem isn't that we're not working at it. It's that we have these misconceptions about the kinds of things that are really going to make us feel better. But, you know, we really need that. We need some, like, work to figure out the right sorts of things that will make us feel good.</blockquote>

### [12:19] The Habit of Hedonic Adaptation


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (10:57 - 12:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8c76287-2e86-4a7d-a53d-61973a08f3fb)




### ‚ú® Summary
Our minds have a bias of getting used to things over time, even the fantastic aspects of life. This phenomenon, known as hedonic adaptation, causes us to stop appreciating even the best moments that we once cherished. As we get accustomed to the good things in life, we tend to take them for granted and fail to notice their significance. Consequently, no matter how well our life is going, we gradually cease to recognize and value the positive aspects that once brought us joy and satisfaction.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But there's a second bias that's just this dumb feature of our mind, which is that we get used to stuff. You know, you start earning a million dollars and you get all the stuff that comes with it. You know, in week one, when you get a nice house with a nice shower and a nice car that feels good. But you know, by week two or three, that's just your shower, that's just your car, that's just your house. You've stopped noticing all the great things about it. And this is like, you know, a bad feature of human psychology for all the fantastic things in life. Even the best things in life, we will wind up getting used to. Yeah, Dan Gilbert, who's a psychologist at Harvard who writes about this stuff, uses the example of like, you know, the first time your child says mommy or daddy, or the first time your Spouse who you're totally in love with says I love you. You know, that was a moment. Like that was, you know, you wrote about it on social media and your journal. That was, but you know, last Thursday when your kid said, you know, mommy or daddy, or you know, like running out the door when your spouse said I love you, it doesn't, it lacks the same Oomph. So even these best moments in life, if they repeat over time, kind of get boring. And this is what researchers call hedonic adaptation. It's the reason why even when we get the good things, even if they stick around, we stop appreciating them as much. Because we kind of just get used to them. And these two things together, this kind of reference point comparisons and hedonic adaptation, it means even if your life is going as well as you could have possibly expected, you'll Stop noticing that it's going so well over time.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>How would you define happiness?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Happiness is typically measured subjectively by asking individuals to self-report their level of happiness. While some may view this method as less scientific, validated self-report scales are considered true scientific instruments that correlate with other measures such as detailed hormonal analysis, interviews, and physiological markers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And how do we measure happiness? Like, how do we even come to some sort of quantitative approach to this?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I wish there was better ways to measure, you know, as a scientist, I wish there was, like, a little, like, happiness thermometer that I could put in your mouth. I was like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, like, you're 80, you know, 80.1, happy or something. We don't have that, and we don't have that for good reason, which is, you know, happiness is subjective, right? Like, the best person to tell me whether or not you're happy is you. And so the way psychologists often measure it is that we just ask people, which sounds not very scientific. It sounds when you would help people a lot of this work is based on self-reports. I think they think those self-reports are, like, some crap, like, you know, quiz that you'd get, like, on BuzzFeed or something. And, you know, you can have self-report scales that are true scientific instruments that have been really well validated. We know that they're measuring something that is, like, a true construct in the world. We know that these self-report measures correlate with things like, if I were to do, like, a detailed hormonal analysis, or, you know, like, detailed interviews with your friends And family members, or, you know, certain physiological markers, like, we know those things correlate.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Engaging in flow-inducing activities such as cooking and paddleboarding can help break out of emotional states and lead to a more fulfilling leisure experience. These activities require attention and prevent excessive mind wandering, offering a cathartic experience. The essence of fun lies in flow, as identified by Catherine Price in her book 'The Power of Fun'. Incorporating flow-inducing activities in leisure can enhance enjoyment and satisfaction.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But by staying in that local minimum, you're sort of missing out on opportunities for the kind of engagement that could pop you out of those emotional states. It's interesting as you're saying that I'm thinking the types of leisure activities that I most enjoy are all encompassing, right? So they're sort of like cooking, they're paddleboarding. These sort of things where you have to pay attention and you can't really, I mean, your mind can wander, but I can't go very far. And they're they're cathodic in that that way rather than the channel surfing.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And I think, you know, when we think about what we really want out of our leisure, I think it's flow inducing activities and it might also be activities that you, you want to call fun. Right. And, you know, people, there's actually not that much empirical work on fun, but Catherine Price, who I mentioned before, who does this work on technology and phones, is also has a new Book called the power of fun. Great book. If you kind of want, you know, like if you're struggling with your leisure and you want some good ideas, but, but she argues is the first ingredient of fun is that is flow.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Time allocation across different socioeconomic statuses is an important factor to consider, not just discretionary income. Loss aversion kicks in when people start earning money, making them reluctant to lose their hard-earned salary and the story they've built around their achievements.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, it's interesting because we often think of discretion. We talk about percentage of discretionary income that goes to like groceries and sort of goes to gas and all of this stuff, especially now as inflation is rearing its head. But we never think about like the percentage of time that people have to spend on certain activities and how that correlates across different socioeconomic statuses. And to your point about sort of having people who once they're earning money, well, now it's loss aversion, right? So you get two things, two powerful forces working for you. One is loss aversion. I don't want to lose the salary that I've worked so hard to get. And all of these forces that drove me to get to this place and the story that I'm telling myself about why I'm here doesn't just turn off like a light switch now that you've sort of reached Some tipping point.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Personal economic struggles can lead individuals to project a negative view of the economy overall, despite positive economic indicators like GDP
2. Economic health is measured by production and revenue growth, not just individual earnings and spending
3. Increasing debt levels at national and household levels may contribute to an economy's growth, even if personal financial struggles persist

### [50:23] Personal Economic Perception vs. Economic Indicators


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (48:52 - 50:24)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ed52ca05-4cef-4f48-b037-c163f34af9ee)




### ‚ú® Summary
People often project their personal financial struggles onto the broader economy, assuming a tough personal situation indicates a poor economy. This perception focuses on individual earnings and spending. However, economists define economic health based on production and revenue growth. While economic indicators like GDP may suggest growth, it could be fueled by increasing debt levels at both national and household levels. As a result, personal financial struggles may not align with broader economic indicators of growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think the whole thing comes down to the projection of an individual or a household of their lived experience onto the economy. You assume that because you're having a tough time, the economy is bad. And the economy as a definition for them is, how do I earn? And how do I spend? And if I'm under earning, that means there must be serious job loss. And things are more expensive and my ability to purchase isn't improving. And so I think we're all kind of going to end up on the same take on this one. I mean, Nick, if you want to pull this image up, this is, I think, a helpful one, which is disposable personal income relative to outlays that folks are needing to spend more than they're Making. So clearly indicating that they're feeling like they're under earning. So the projection of that is the economy is bad without recognizing that it is an inflationary experience, whereas economists use the definition of, quote, economic growth being Gross production, gross product. And so if gross product or gross revenue is going up, they're like, oh, the economy is healthy. We're growing. But the truth is we're funding that growth was leverage at the national level, the federal level and at the household and domestic level. We are borrowing money to inflate the revenue numbers. And so the GDP goes up, but the debt is going up higher. And so the ability for folks to support themselves and buy things that they want to buy and continue to improve their condition in life has declined if things are getting worse.</blockquote>

1. Xi Jinping has eliminated any potential successors, creating a super unitary system in China similar to countries like Russia and France.
2. Balancing autonomy and centralization in governing systems is challenging in China, historically leading to potential fragmentation or conflict.
3. China currently employs a hyper-centralized system under the Communist Party's General Secretary.

### [02:27] One-Man Rule in a Super-Unitary System

### ‚ú® Summary
The current leadership in China under Xi Jinping has eradicated any potential successor, creating a system where Xi is the sole authority. Xi has eliminated individuals with ambition or competence, making it impossible for anyone under 25 to enter the system. This has transformed China's supposedly federal system into a super unitary one, akin to the governing style of countries like Russia and France. With Xi at the helm, all decisions and policies in Beijing hold supreme importance, consolidating power at the national level.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There is no successor. There is no potential successor. There is no up and coming cadre of people with talent. He has basically purged the entire system of any without ambition or competence. Him and the bureaucracy now is going after things like patents and college dissertations so that no one who is under age 25 can even get into the system in the first place. So it is just Xi, it is Xi alone and he will ride this system into the ground. It's so much worse than that sounds because China is not a normal country so there are different sorts of governing systems, confederal, federal, and unitary. Confederal, your regions have more power than the center, so I think Switzerland or Canada. In a federal system, there's a shared competence among the national government, the regional governments, the local governments, think Germany or maybe the United States. And then there are unitary systems where the national government basically sets all policy and everyone just has to go along with it. That's Russia, that is France, that is Argentina. Technically, China's federal, but because of the purges and because of the control of the Communist Party, it has basically become super unitary where everything that happens in Beijing is the only thing that matters, because Xi has purged all of the regional local governments of anyone who has any capacity.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Balancing autonomy and centralization in governing systems is a challenge in areas prone to conflict and environmental challenges like flood and drought. The history of Chinese dynasties shows two main governing models: one with regions having autonomy leading to potential fragmentation and civil war, and the other hyper-centralizing authority in Beijing, which also proves unsustainable. Finding a middle ground with a confederal system has not been successful historically, leading to friction and conflict among regions. Currently, China employs a hyper-centralized system under the Communist Party's General Secretary.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so you would generally have warlords trying to take over individual chunks of the territory and because this is also a flood and a drought -prone area, the water works were necessary To maintain the population. So when a warlord thought he was going to lose or wanted to launch an attack on a neighbor, he'd go after the water works. Anyway, so you get this nationalistic militaristic north. You get kind of a corporatist, industrialist, financial center, and then what has traditionally been a secessionist south, and keeping these all under the same rubric, under the Same governing system, is hard. And so you have to basically look at Chinese history from this point of view, and that there's kind of two models Model number one is each region has as much autonomy as it can stomach and The whole thing spins apart and the north in particular Falls into civil war was a reason why all of China's dynasties never last very long. It's hard to hold this all together or You overcompensate the other direction and hyper concentrate authority in Beijing under the Emperor, or now under the Communist Party's General Secretary, and hold everything as tight as possible. Neither of them last for long, and unfortunately there's nothing in between that works really well either, kind of a confederal system which just led to friction and eventually conflict Among the various sections. Well at the we are clearly having a hyper -centralized system.</blockquote>

### [02:47] Training for Imitation and Specific Behavior


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:09 - 02:44)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a49b17c8-70f8-4cc3-9875-87fa3839fa9b)




### ‚ú® Summary
The pre-training phase involves training a model to imitate all internet content and maximize likelihood, resulting in a model that can generate varied web-like content. Tokens like words are used, and the model is calibrated to assign probabilities to everything. Post-training focuses on a specific behavior, such as being a helpful chat assistant, where the objective is to produce outputs that humans will find useful and like, rather than imitating raw web content.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In pre-training, you're basically training to imitate all of the content on the internet or on the web, including websites and code and so forth. So you get a model that can basically generate content that looks like random web pages from the internet. And the model is also trained to maximize likelihood where it has to put a probability on everything. So the objective is basically predicting the next token given the previous tokens. Tokens are like words or parts of words. And since the model has to put a probability on it and we're training to maximize log probability, it ends up being very calibrated. So it can not only generate all of the content of the web, it can also assign probabilities to everything. So the base model can effectively take on all of these different personas or generate all these different kinds of content. And then when we do post-training, we're usually targeting a narrower range of behavior where we basically want the model to behave like this kind of chat assistant. And it's a more specific persona where it's trying to be helpful. It's not trying to imitate a person. It's answering your questions or doing your tasks. And we're optimizing on a different objective, which is more about producing outputs that humans will like and find useful, as opposed to just trying to imitate this raw content from The web.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
If AGI arrives sooner than expected, the plan is to slow down on training and deployment until there is a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities. The caution involves not training an even smarter version, ensuring proper sandboxing, and being careful about the scale at which it is deployed.

We can deal with it safely and we have a pretty good hands along what it's going to do, what it can do. So, I think we would have to be very careful if it happened way sooner than expected because I think our understanding is rudimentary in a lot of ways still.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And what would be careful mean, because presumably you are already careful, right? You do these evaluations before you're. Yeah, I would say.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Just like maybe not training the even smarter version, not being really careful when you do train it, that it's not like properly sandboxing everything. Maybe not deploying at that scale or being careful about what scale you deploy it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I guess I'm not.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
AI is envisioned to assist in technically sophisticated tasks, such as programming and research, to accelerate science. The potential lies in AI being able to understand vast amounts of literature, sift through data quickly, and enable individuals to efficiently tackle multiple tasks. The ideal scenario involves humans driving the process while utilizing AI as helpful assistance to address diverse problems, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.

More women than men are attending college, and the majority of jobs now require a college degree. Consequently, women are increasingly out-earning men, leading to more women owning homes and earning more in urban areas. However, this shift may impact household formation, as fewer economically and emotionally viable partners could lead to lower birth rates and increased loneliness. Addressing this may require social programs and tax policies that provide more financial support to young people.

In urban metros in the United States, people under the age of 30, women are now, in most of those cities, making more money than the men, because they come more credentialed, more single Women owned homes than single men. This is a good thing. This is a good thing. And what we need to acknowledge though, is that this is gonna have a real impact on household formation. One, because men made social economically horizontally and down, women horizontally and up. And when the pool of horizontal and up gets smaller and smaller, it means more, or fewer and fewer young people are going to find a partner they find economically and emotionally viable. Women are gonna have a tougher time finding economically and emotionally viable men. And there's gonna be less household formation, lower birth rates, more loneliness. I don't have a silver bullet here. What I do think we need are more and more social programs and tax policy that put more money in the pockets of young people. As it relates to you, you're obviously doing well. The fact that your wife is earning more than you, I think should be celebrated.</blockquote>

And a cause for happiness, not grim, murderous determination or sadism or, but just joy. And so it's something that I think people find it very hard to interpret these scenes. And I think they've just averted their eyes from them. But they do suggest that any bright line we want to draw between, you know, evil, mustache, twirling terrorists, you know, i.e. The core members of Hamas and other Palestinians is in fact difficult to draw.

### ‚ú® Summary
Military operations face a crucial ethical dilemma of distinguishing between civilian and military targets, especially challenging in urban areas. Hamas's tactics of human shields and sacrifices highlight the complexity of this issue, with civilians not allowed in their tunnels indicating a strategic ploy. The situation in Gaza contrasts with instances like Ukraine, where civilians sought refuge in subway tunnels, becoming hostages. The presence of rockets, tunnels, and hostages pose unique challenges and dilemmas to military strategies, unlike any faced in modern times.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You can't that's the underlying thing is do not target civilians and only target military sites and that's really hard to do in urban areas. But there's lots of rules that we can talk about on that. So Hamas deployed this human shield strategy, but also a human sacrifice strategy where, and I don't know why the world just won't take for on its head what Hamas says like, literally, They tell you these things in the world's like, yeah, but they're the fact that they say they want as many of their civilians to die as possible. And one evidence of that is the fact that there are 400 miles of tunnels in Gaza and not one civilian is allowed in them. The entire population 2.2 million could fit in Hamas's tunnels with ease, where you take in another example in another war like Ukraine's war where the civilians did seek refuge in The subway tunnels and underground and the hostages. So the fact that Hamas immediately took over 240 hostages, which really gets to the time variable, right? So in understanding the challenge that the idea of face, you have to factor in the rockets, the tunnels, the hostages, which really get to your alternatives on, we'll just wait, just Pursue some other strategy and just leave your hostages in captivity. So all those variables, no military has faced that in modern times, none.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
As artificial general intelligence (AGI) develops, it prompts profound questions about the role of human existence and purpose. The computational capabilities of AI, potentially merged with human cognition, may enhance our understanding of life meaning. The human limbic system drives our will and desires, contributing to our motivations, including the pursuit of happiness and power. This interplay between human emotions and AI suggests that in a positive future scenario, AI could focus on enhancing human emotional experiences while acknowledging the complexity of our motivations.

### ‚ú® Summary
The integration of artificial intelligence with human cognitive abilities may enhance computational power and expand humanity's capabilities. This relationship raises profound questions about existence and purpose, particularly concerning the meaning of life. The human limbic system, which drives our motivations and desires, interacts with higher cognitive processes to shape our actions. In a positive scenario, AI could be designed to support and enhance human fulfillment, seeking to satisfy the intrinsic desires driven by our limbic system. Furthermore, this interplay suggests a complex dynamic of motivations, where both primal feelings and aspirations for power influence human behavior.

### ‚ú® Summary
To tackle problems effectively, it‚Äôs crucial to adopt a mindset of intentional deletion. This involves assessing what can be removed from a system or process, with the understanding that some deleted items may eventually need to be reinstated. However, the tendency to fear the repercussions of past deletions often leads to over-complication as individuals compensate by increasing the amount of information and resources retained. By consciously deciding to delete more than what seems prudent, one can embrace a more streamlined approach, knowing that re-adding a fraction of the deleted items is part of refining the system.

Yeah. Yeah, that's not easy to do. No, and actually, this, what generally makes people uneasy is that you've got to delete at least some of the things that you delete you will put back in. Yeah. But going back to sort of where our limbic system can steer us wrong is that we tend to remember with sometimes a jarring level of pain where we deleted something that we subsequently Needed. And so people will remember that one time they forgot to put in this thing three years ago and that caused them trouble. And so they overcorrect. And then they put too much stuff in there and over complicate things. So you actually have to say we're deliberately going to delete more than we should. So that we're putting at least one in ten things we're going to add back in.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The best way to accumulate wealth since the Industrial Revolution is through international cooperation and adherence to treaties and laws rather than territorial conquests and violence. By creating and respecting international institutions and agreements, nations can engage in global trade without the risk of conflict or loss of life, leading to greater prosperity for those who participate in this system.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Then you think after Blitzkrieg, suppose that before Stalingrad, he had stopped. At that point, didn't he control 30% of the Soviet Union? He'll never hold it. He'll choke on his acquisitions. Did Germany have the power under another leader to just hold that whole section of Eurasia?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>All right, I'm going to flip this whole argument. You're talking about people doing territorial conquests and taking things and butchering enormous numbers of people to get it. You can watch this in real time in Ukraine. This is how it goes. You're butchering a lot of people. You're destroying wealth at an incredibly rapid club. You can do that. But it's really wealth destroying. Since the Industrial Revolution in the West, there has been a growing consensus that that's probably not the way to do things. We are far better crafting international institutions, international laws, treaties that we sign on to, the parts that we want to, and then we adhere to them. And then that allows us to go all over the world running our little credit card transactions. No one kills us. And you can make a lot of wealth doing that. And that was the conclude that if you look at since the Industrial Revolution, who's making all the money, people who buy into that system.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Compounding plays a crucial role in economic growth, as exemplified by Tyler Cowan's illustration showing that a 1% lower annual growth rate over decades could significantly impact a country's GDP. Sanctions may not create immediate change in behavior but can weaken the target country over time by suppressing growth. The comparison of North and South Korea illustrates the long-term impact of sanctions, leading to one country becoming stronger while the other weakens. The success of Russia after World War II prompts the question of why some countries perform exceptionally well economically.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And that the compounding is a very important point, because I think Tyler Cowan is an example in one of his books that if US economic growth rates have been 1% lower every year from 1890 To basically the 20th century, they had been 1% lower each year. The US per capita, GDP would be lower than that of Mexico's.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Bingo. And this is to give a tangential comment. This is how sanctions work. People look at sanctions and go, oh, they don't work because you don't make the whoever's annoying you change whatever they're doing. What they do do is they suppress growth so that whoever's annoying you over time, you're stronger and they're weaker. And the example of the impact of sanctions is compared North and South Korea. Right. Yeah. It's powerful over several generations.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Right. Now, but to the question about why Russia did so well. Did so well. Or in this terms of after World War II ended up with so much.</blockquote>

And so I studied first learning about Russia. And then I decided I was going to learn about China. And I realized, oh, I'll learn about those two, Japan's in there. So I got to learn about Japan and wind up studying their relations and try to be open minded and understand the world from their point of view, not that it's right or wrong, but just trying To understand it. So for your point of view, when you're picking up a book and you want to avoid half court tennis, give the book a 30 second rule, what's that? Go flip to the bibliography, flip through it for 30 seconds, and see if at least some of the citations are in the languages of the countries being discussed. Because how much respect would you have for a book about the United States that has not a single source in English? I suspect the answer would be zero.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And how do you consume these? Do you read the translations?</blockquote>

### [01:05:33] Discussion on NATO, Russia, and Eastern Europe


[üéß Play snip - 4minÔ∏è (01:01:52 - 01:05:33)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e2f0a7f-3348-4058-8082-4aff8ffb20d8)




### ‚ú® Summary
The discussion highlights the importance of considering the perspectives of the countries in Eastern Europe who joined NATO to protect themselves from Russian aggression. These countries have experienced an improvement in living standards since being freed from Soviet domination. The hope was to integrate Russia into the Western world to improve their economy and governance. However, Russian standards of living have stagnated under Putin's model, which relies on taking over neighboring countries. It is crucial to prioritize the security of Eastern European countries and the broader implications on European geopolitics, especially in the context of deterrence against the threat of nuclear war.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think people who are, you know, less empathetic to the Ukraine cause upside, well, extending NATO, which we thought would be deterrence is that was actually a provocation for Putin. But what should we just generally make of that lesson?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>First of all, I think you should look at the people living in the countries in question. So before we decide that we're the important people in the world, Americans or we're in Britain now or Britain's, and therefore anyone in between doesn't count, I believe that's wrong. So all of the countries that joined NATO desperately wanted to join NATO, right? And they've had a whole history of Russians doing terrible things to them. I'm not making it up. This is what Russia's been up to. They have been correct that Russia's going to do more terrible things. They were correct doing everything they could to get into NATO. And also be in the EU and they've, it's incredible in my lifetime. Remembering what the standards of living of people in Eastern Europe, that the Soviet Union had dominated and what it is now. Since they have been freed of Soviet domination, it's been massive compounding of standards of living. It's allowed people your age to travel the world, have a lot of aspirations in their lives. Right?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>There's no podcasting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>If when you talk about, oh, should we deny these things because we got some egos in Russia that want to maintain a continental empire? I cannot or you cannot change how Russians think about things. Right? Russians have to, how they think about the things, that's their decision. But if you look at Europe as a peninsula, you're better off with more insulation from Russia than not.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But isn't this another case that not thinking in terms of both courts or both halves of the court and tennis where compared to the possibility of nuclear war, just nudging that on number Up and down matters far more than whether another country in Eastern Europe gets to be part of NATO or not?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, I think what was hoped and it's, hope has been said not to be a strategy. The hope was that trying to get Russia to join the party. So trying to integrate their energy supplies into Europe, paying them good money for it, have them make lots of money on that, hoping that they would invest this into their road system, Which is lamentable, and hoping that they would invest this to cleaning out their business laws, which are, it's horrendous trying to run a business. As you watch right now, as different things get nationalized and taken over and different business leaders who are successful wind up unaccountably dropping out of six floor windows And things or old people always seem to fall down stairs. I think that's a special way of offing people. That was the hope is join the party because you will become wealthy too. Russian standards of living have been stagnating for quite a while that Putin's model of the basically taking over your neighbor's stuff and then whatever you have a bomb flat bringing Home is it's not an efficient way to make wealth and you're killing so many people. So I don't believe that we in the West have this denying people of Eastern Europe saying, well, actually, because the Russians have such an attitude, you get to be their serfs forever.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Or I guess it's not about, not that it's just, but there are broader considerations for the same reason that you</blockquote>

### [01:27:35] Underestimating the Economic Burden of Surveillance


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:26:29 - 01:27:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fdb79d3-13d2-4961-a2ed-71309ac48482)




### ‚ú® Summary
Communist states and dictatorships often struggle to accurately assess the economic burden of their military and surveillance apparatus due to the lack of transparent, convertible currency and pervasive culture of deception. This results in a distorted perception of the true cost, leading to a significant allocation of resources towards security and defense, as seen in the case of the Soviet Union during the Cold War where over half of the economy was dedicated to the military industrial complex.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You were talking about the cost of the surveillance. I've actually, this is an interesting question of what percentage of the Soviet Union's GDP was dedicated to the NKVD or civil rights?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think when we were, the United States was trying to evaluate what the load of the military was on the economy and the CIA was trying to figure it out to the best of their ability. And then because they don't have a convertible currency, it's really difficult to, and then they're busy lying to each other. That's the whole other thing in communist states and dictatorships. You're incentivized to lie about everything. And think about the compounding effects of these lies. It means, I can't make good decisions because everyone around me is lying. And then it gets worse at the top. You're going to watch as these cascading things happen to the Chinese and the Russians as a result. So it turned out at the end of the Cold War, gosh, I can't remember it accurately over the top of my head. But if you did the whole military industrial complex, it's well over half their economy. It's being devoted to this.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
A world order where the United States acts as the sole hegemon is not sustainable. Collaborating with various influential countries in a maritime order can lead to a win-win situation. The United States, along with other nations, is working on managing global issues through agreement and collaboration, as seen in meetings with Europeans regarding Ukraine. The prosperity of nations is linked to participating in a maritime order. The growth of third-world countries has been significant since the Cold War, but challenges like private military interference from China in Africa can slow down growth. It is crucial to prioritize collaboration and agreements between nations for sustainable prosperity.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great. But no one's going to buy on, buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone else around. I get it. We're big and we're influential. Other people are influential too. But this maritime order where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other people in it. It's a win-win. And you can look at some with Biden right now, he's doing all of these meetings with Europeans. Of managing of what's going to go on in Ukraine, etc. And it's based on agreement of all these different countries, Chipping and Big and Small. And it's a, and who's prosperous and who's not? May I ask?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>The the maritime.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, they are. And who are the ones who have massively increased their standards of living since the Cold War? It was really the third world. Except now we got Wagner or whatever's left of it. And also China's now got these private military things running roughshod over Africa, which all that's going to do is tank African growth rates, which for a while we're going double-digit. So that's one of my big career takeaways.</blockquote>

### [11:45] Crafting Prompts for AI to Access Super Genius Information


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (10:12 - 11:48)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e09a163c-3182-4347-bb3a-af458b4d469d)




### ‚ú® Summary
Training AI models on average internet data results in average responses as the model is taught to be very average. However, the dataset also contains information from really smart individuals, posing a challenge on how to prompt the AI to access this super genius part of the dataset. By crafting prompts differently, it can navigate to different parts of the data set, yielding varying responses. For instance, prompting the AI to write code will result in average code unless prompted differently.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and then there's a related question that comes up a lot. It's an argument we've been having internally, which is also start to take some sort of more provocative and probably more bullish, or as you would put it, sort of science fictiony predictions On some of this stuff. So there's this question that comes up, which is, okay, you take an L .M., you train it on the internet. What is the internet data? What is the internet data corpus? It's an average of everything, right? It's a representation of sort of human activity. Representation of human activity is going to kind of, you know, because of the sort of distribution of intelligence in the population, you know, most of it somewhere in the middle. And so the data set on average sort of represents the average human.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You're teaching it to be very average. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. You average. And so therefore the answer is our average, right? You're going to get back an answer that sort of represents the kind of thing that an average 100 IQ, you know, kind of by definition, the average human is 100 IQ, it's IQ is indexed to 100. That's the center of the bell curve. And so by definition, you're kind of getting back the average. I actually argue that may be the case for the default prompt today. You just ask the thing, does the Earth revolve around the sun or something? You get the average answer to that, and maybe that's fine. This gets to the point as, well, OK, the average data might be of an average person. But the data set also contains all of the things written and thought by all the really smart people. All that stuff is in there, and all the current people who are like that, their stuff is in there. And so then it's sort of like a prompting question, which is like, how do you prompt it in order to get basically, in order to basically navigate to a different part of what they call the Latent space, to navigate to a different part of the data set that basically is like the super genius part. And the way these things work is if you craft the prompt in a different way, it actually leads it down a different path inside the data set, gives you a different kind of answer. And here's another example of this. If you it, write code to do X, write code to sort of list or, you know, whatever, render an image, it will give you average code to do that.</blockquote>

### [31:40] The Jevons Paradox in Software Development


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (30:24 - 31:42)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0238c7eb-dfa2-4a28-ac5c-1789c761b757)




### ‚ú® Summary
The Jevons Paradox is evident in software development, where the cost of creating software falls, leading to a surge in demand for software capabilities, resulting in higher prices. This phenomenon occurs as companies innovate and improve software products, increasing customer satisfaction and creating a demand for more advanced features. Similar effects have been observed in other industries like Hollywood, where advancements like CGI have raised audience expectations, leading to more expensive movies.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so this is you see versions of this, for example, you build in your freeway and it actually makes traffic jams worse. Right. Because basically what happens is, oh, it's great. Now there's more roads. Now we can have more people live here. We can have more people that you know, we can make these companies bigger and others more traffic than ever. And now the traffic's even worse. Or you saw the classic example is during the Industrial Revolution, coal consumption as the price of coal drops. People use so much more coal that actually the overall consumption actually increased. People were getting a lot more power, but the result was the use of a lot more coal in the paradox. And so the paradox here would be, yes, the cost of developing any given piece of software falls, but the reaction to that is a massive surge of demand for software capabilities. And so the result of that actually is, although it even, it looks like starting software companies, the price is going to fall, actually it's going to happen, it's going to rise. For the high quality reason that you're going to be able to do so much more. Yeah. Right. With software, the products are going to be so much better and the roadmap is going to be so amazing of the things you can do and the customers are going to be so happy with it that they're Going to want more and more and more. Yeah. The result of it, and by the way, another example of Jevons Faradox playing out in another related industry is in Hollywood, CGI in theory should have reduced the price of making movies In reality has increased it because audience expectations went up. And now you go to a Hollywood movie and it's wall -to -wall CGI. And so movies are more expensive to make than ever.</blockquote>

[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (21:53 - 23:28)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ddd6d860-194c-4ac6-98be-8947c91a1c0b)




### ‚ú® Summary
A tightly knit industrial network can create a false sense of security for a region, as evidenced by Detroit's car industry. Over time, mismanagement and decentralization can lead to companies relocating, causing the network to collapse. Similar patterns can be observed in California's tech industry, where an initial concentration of companies in one place can be disrupted by shifts in market dynamics, such as the recent changes driven by the COVID pandemic and emerging technologies like cryptocurrency. The internet's initial promise to lessen geographical constraints paradoxically reinforced the concentration of tech companies in California, illustrating the complexities of industrial networks and their vulnerability.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Sure. But if it wasn't as networked, you could probably just move. And maybe these things are networked till they're not. Detroit was very networked. The car industry was super networked on Detroit for decades and decades and Michigan got more and more mismanaged and people thought the network sort of protected them because the Big three car companies were in Detroit but then you had all the supply chains were also in Detroit and then eventually it was just so ridiculous. People moved, started moving the factories outside of that area and it sort of unraveled. So that's ‚Äì it can also happen with California.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It will just take a lot. Trevor Burrus That would be insane if they just abandon all the tech companies in California. I mean just look at what happened to Flint, Michigan, when all the auto factories pulled out.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Richard Pena Well, it's ‚Äì look, I think you can ‚Äì and it's always ‚Äì there are all these paradoxical histories. The internet, the point of the internet in some sense was to eliminate the tyranny of place and that was sort of the idea. Then one of the paradoxes about the internet ‚Äì history of the internet was that the internet companies were all centered in California. Then there probably, there have been different waves of how networked, how non-networked they were.

### ‚ú® Summary
Despite advancements in technology, the actual speed of travel and movement has declined compared to several decades ago. The decommissioning of the Concorde and increased security measures have contributed to longer travel times. Simultaneously, modern highways experience more traffic jams, reflecting a regression in infrastructure efficiency. This stagnation in the physical world is juxtaposed with the distractions of digital devices, which divert attention from the lack of tangible progress. As human beings inhabit a material world, the significance of physical environments remains crucial, highlighting the disproportion between the evolving digital realm and the largely unchanged world of atoms.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We're not moving any faster. The Concorde got decommissioned in 2003 or whenever and then with all the low-tech airport security measures it takes even longer to fly, to get through all of them from one city to the Next. The highways have gone backwards because there are more traffic jams. We haven't figured out ways around those. So they're sort of, we're literally moving slower than we were 40 or 50 years ago. And then, yeah, and that's sort of the, that's sort of the, and then, you know, the, and then of course, there's also a sense in which these, the screens and the devices, you know, have This effect distracts. Us from this. So you know, when you're, you know, riding a 100-year subway in New York City and you're looking at your iPhone, you can look at, wow, this is this cool new gadget, but you're also being Distracted from the fact that your lived environment hasn't changed, you know, in a hundred years. And so there's a question how important is this world of bits versus the world of atoms. You know, I would say as human beings we're physically embodied in a material world and so I would always say this world of atoms is pretty important and when that's pretty stagnant, You know, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense.</blockquote>

> In this episode, my guest is  Dr. Jonathan Haidt, Ph.D. , professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author on how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.<br/>>  He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution ‚Äî all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function.¬†<br/>>  Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation.¬†<br/>>  This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.<br/>>  For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit  hubermanlab.com .<br/>>  Thank you to our sponsors  AG1:  https://drinkag1.com/huberman ¬†<br/>>  Helix Sleep:  https://helixsleep.com/huberman <br/>>  AeroPress:  https://aeropress.com/huberman <br/>>  Joovv:  https://joovv.com/huberman <br/>>  LMNT:  https://drinklmnt.com/huberman <br/>>  Timestamps  00:00:00 Dr. Jonathan Haidt<br/>>  00:02:01 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, AeroPress   Gen Z Development<br/>>  00:55:24 Play   Identity; Social Media, Learning   Tool: ‚ÄúAwe Walks‚Äù<br/>>  02:03:14 Casino Analogy   Social Media Content<br/>>  02:09:33 Adult Behavior; Tool: Meals   Tool: Family Groups & Phones<br/>>  02:16:09 Screens & Future Optimism, Collective Action, KOSA Bill<br/>>  02:24:52 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter<br/>>   Disclaimer

### [10:56] The Great Rewiring of Childhood


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (09:39 - 11:03)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5c77dca2-297d-49a1-8355-7bb1c50b6de7)




### ‚ú® Summary
The period between 2010 and 2015 marked a significant shift in technology's impact on childhood, especially with the rise of social media. Initially, teenagers used flip phones for basic communication, but the introduction of smartphones with front-facing cameras enabled extensive usage. With platforms like Instagram being exclusive to smartphones, teens could now spend hours daily on their devices, reshaping their daily activities drastically.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's really especially social media, which has changed things. And so if we look at a kid, let's take a teenager in 2010, let's say January, 2010. At that point, there's no Instagram, there's no front -facing camera. They all have, mostly they have flip phones. The iPhone came out in 2007, but they don't mostly have them. And so in 2010, most teenagers are using the flip phone as a tool to each other, text each other, meet up. So when technology helps us achieve our goals, that's good. By 2015, everything's different. By 2015, the great majority of Americans, certainly teens, have a smartphone with a front facing camera. The girls are mostly on Instagram, which was the first social media platform that you had to be on a smartphone for. Everything else was web -based. They have high -speed internet, unlimited texting, and now it's possible to spend 10, 15 hours a day on your phone. Nobody could do that with a flip phone. So I point to that, it's that five -year period, 2010 to 2015, which I've called the great rewiring of childhood, because it affects everything, everything about what children and Teenagers are doing.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I can recall in 2010, I was actually in New York city visiting friends. I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at one 30 in the morning scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting.</blockquote>

It was so satisfying to sing somebody's battleship.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So boys really want to play at war. And I really learned this when I was 30 and my, I have a group of buddies from college and we get together once a year. And one year I hosted in Charlottesville and we, we played paintball. We went to a paintball place and there were about five or seven other guys and we divided up into teams and we were divided among ourselves on the teams. And it was unbelievably thrilling to work with other guys to hunt and shoot my friends. And we came out afterwards, all of us, and it hurts when you hit the paintball. Yeah, those things hurt. It hurts, which is important. It's actually very important because then you really take it seriously. You really don't wanna get shot. But it was absolutely thrilling. It really felt like there was a room in my heart. As a man, there's a room in my heart for war that had never been opened. So boys wanna play at that. And then the video games, the first person shooting games, all these things let them do that. The other thing of course that boys want to do is look at naked women. And so, you know, it used to be Playboy magazine. Now it's super hardcore sex with anal sex and gang bangs and, you know, choking and all sorts of things. So the boys really get, that's heat trap a boy.</blockquote>

### [49:25] Learning in Intimate Relationships vs. Drug Use


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (48:05 - 49:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc6733ad-0fdc-454f-bb54-856b0626edc0)




### ‚ú® Summary
Intimate relationships involve effort, learning, and communication, especially for men. In contrast, drug use like methamphetamine or cocaine does not offer learning about the dopamine system, and pornography does not provide insights into sex and courtship. Pornography can lead to a passive observation of sex, hindering real-world engagement. Men experiencing issues like erectile dysfunction and anxiety often lack the ability to translate their pleasure in real-world sexual experiences due to overreliance on pornography. This leads to viewing potential partners as distant and unfamiliar.

And it takes learning. There's hardly any learning in the use of a drug like methamphetamine or cocaine about how your dopamine system works, unconscious learning. And there's hardly any, if any, learning about sex and courtship in pornography. And it's also training the dopamine system, the whole motivational system around sex, to be observational as opposed to participatory. And I hear a lot because I'm in the wellness health space, and I'm a man, guys reach out by direct message, hey, listen, they'll reach out that they're having real issues with erectile Dysfunction, with anxiety. And these things always existed, but there was a kind of a, a learning, a communication, hopefully some, you know, slow your breathing down and communicate and kind of get back to a place Where you're more comfortable. They're not able to translate anything about their experience of sex and pleasure the real world. And as a consequence, they're retreating into a world where they view, if they're heterosexual, the opposite sex, or if they're homosexual, the same sex, potential partners as like These distant foreign objects that they don't understand.

### ‚ú® Summary
Exposing oneself to disturbing or graphic content can have a detrimental impact on the brain's effectiveness. Young people should be cautious about what they watch and engage with on social media platforms, as such experiences can have lasting effects on their mental health and well-being. It is essential to be mindful of what content one consumes to safeguard their neuro real estate and maintain a healthy mindset.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That is, if they're going to be entering a domain in which prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers, you're making them be brand managers, you're making Them be performative, this is not playful, they're going to be exposed to horrible, horrible things. I now ask young people, is there something that you saw when you were young that you really regret seeing? And a lot of them have an answer. My 21 year old doorman just told me about the gauntlet, running the gauntlet. It's a series of 20 videos. It's a challenge. Can you watch these 20 videos, end with, you know, a Mexican drug gang dismembering a person who's alive? Things like that. Like, yes, I'm tough enough. I can do that. Really? At what age should you, do you want your kids watching people being dismembered? 10, 11? Is that okay? And those images are forever.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>They're forever. That's right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's right.

Like I wouldn't watch the Dalmar movie. Everyone was talking about the Dalmar movie. All I had to see was 10 seconds of the trailer to know I'll pay money not to see that. That's right. Not because I couldn't get through it. I'm sure I could force myself to, but I don't want that in my neuro real estate. That's right. It's just there for obvious reasons.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So let's go back to what you said about neuroplasticity.</blockquote>

### [01:41:22] Restoring Childhood in the Real World

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to restoring childhood in the real world lies in implementing four norms: no smartphone before high school, no social media until 16, phone-free schools, and promoting more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world. By taking these actions collectively, we can create an environment that fosters real-world adventures and memories for children, instead of virtual experiences.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, that's right. And the ability to pay attention to a teacher, which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on TikTok. Yeah, there's tons of learning, it's learning of all the wrong. That's right. That's right. So that's the third norm, is phone -free schools. You have to lock up the phone in the morning, either in a phone locker or a yonder pouch. If the policy is you keep it in your pocket, that's not a policy. That's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids, because they can't help it. They have to text. If anyone's texting, they have to be texting. And the fourth norm is the hardest. The fourth norm is far more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world. Because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone -based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing. What we have to do is restore a really fun, adventurous childhood. Like what you were saying, you go out on your bicycle, you're hanging out with your friends, sometimes something happens. And you have memories. I mean, exciting things happen, scary things happen, you have memories. And I worry about what boys today, I have a group of buddy, my group of friends that I, we still talk about things that happened, amazing things that happened when we were in college or After college. And I wonder what boys, young boys today are going to say, you know, you remember Fortnite game 27 ,363, where you were trapped in that elevator shaft and I had to shoot you out? No, I don't remember that one. You know, like, the virtual adventures are just not going to cut it. Our kids need adventure. They need independence and adventure where they work out the conflicts themselves. So if we do those four things, I we can restore childhood in the real world. No smartphone before high school, no social media till 16, phone -free schools, more independence free play and responsibility in the real world. Those four things. And these are things that we can all do if we work together, if we do them at the same time.</blockquote>

I was attacked a couple of weeks ago when I said, I think, here or maybe on Realtime or maybe both, that I'm not going to lose my nervous system again for a second Trump term, like worrying About it or even if it happens. I did it once and I can't do it again. And when he blows up the world, let me know. I mean, I'll do every I can to speak out against him. But you're right. He's so unpredictable because it's not driven by anything except his insanity and his sloth. You know, he could easily just sit there for four years and eat cheeseburgers and call into Foxman friends every morning. That could be the whole term and all this crazy stuff would go on around him, but fundamentally, nothing would change. It's funny, as much as I hate Trump and don't want to see him as president, when someone comes up to me and they go like, Bill, what are we going to do? This is a part of me that kind of them just assuming, even though it's true. It's like, how do you know I hate Donald Trump that much? I just want to go, your side sucks too. Because, you know, why is he going to get elected again? It's because of Woken up. It's because he's the thing. I blame the Democrats. Yeah. He is exactly what that's the talking point that you need to hear on CNN and MSNBC. Instead of just Trump is off just delve a little into, yes, he's awful, but how about asking why half the country still prefers it? Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, I mean, this is... I think this is Douglas Murray's line or some version of his line.

### ‚ú® Summary
In politics, ambition plays a significant role in shaping perceptions and outcomes. Despite the criticism, Trump's lead among likely voters has increased, indicating a substantial shift in opinions. While Democrats have voiced concerns about Trump's fitness for presidency, the focus is now shifting towards Biden. The narrative suggests that, despite Biden potentially being impaired, he might still be perceived as a better choice for a second term president. The polls highlight how moderates and young voters may prioritize criminality over senility in their decision-making. Trump's silence on Biden's debate performance hints at a strategic move to keep Biden in the race, with the intention to exploit his vulnerabilities if nominated. Ultimately, this narrative underscores the role of ambition in politics and the tactics employed to shape public perception.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The narrative now stands at, I am an old man and worse, another malignant narcissist who won't get out of the way. It's the political equivalent of turning on the radio and hearing John Legend's, All of Me, Again. And again. And again. The result? In the last week, Trump's lead among likely voters increased from 3% to 6%. A substantial shift in a race where the majority have already made up their minds. Democrats have been saying for years, correctly, that Trump is not fit to be president. OK, now do Biden, said the universe. Yes, an impaired Biden would still make a better second term president, but we'll probably never know. The polls say how moderates and young voters will opt for criminality over senility. Real tell is how quiet Trump has been about Biden's debate performance. Trump desperately wants Biden to stay in the race. If or when Biden is nominated and there is no turning back, the Trump media machine will turn him into a vegetable. Ambition is not in itself a bad thing.</blockquote>

### [09:36] Limited Ability to Imagine Endings

### ‚ú® Summary
Our brains struggle to grasp the concept of death since we lack a reference point for it. This limitation leads us to believe that decline and death only happen to others. This inability to envision our own mortality also hinders us from recognizing and accepting smaller endings in life. People in power, like politicians and CEOs, often fail to acknowledge their own limitations and resist the idea of passing on the torch to the younger generation. This resistance results in a detrimental shift of wealth from the young to the elderly. The call for more ageism, particularly in the form of turnover, is emphasized to address these issues.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We can't imagine our own end. Try to picture what it's like to be dead. You can't, not really. You might think of darkness or sleep, things you've actually experienced in this life, but your brain has no meaningful point of reference for the real thing. As a result, we believe decline and death are things reserved for other people. If we are badly designed for the task of conceiving of and accepting our cosmic sell -by dates, we're even less apt to recognize the smaller endings that come along the way. Politicians and CEOs are bad at this. Washington is a large assisted living community full of rich people who believe the world can't get along without them and will never have to. The result has been a disastrous transfer of prosperity from young to old as old people keep voting themselves more money. As I've written before, we need more ageism, specifically churn.

### ‚ú® Summary
The transformation of the Democratic Party has led to a disconnection from its roots, once aligning with working-class values, small businesses, and anti-corporate sentiments. The speaker highlights that the priorities of historical Democratic leaders like Robert and John Kennedy, such as anti-war and anti-censorship, resonate with them, yet the party now caters to a more elite demographic. In contrast, the Republican Party has seemingly shifted to represent the working class and poorer segments of society. This realignment reflects broader socioeconomic divides where the Democratic Party, once a champion of the poor, appears more aligned with the wealthy elite, while the Republican Party gains traction among those feeling left behind.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, and you know, I do want to say that I feel like I didn't really leave the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party left me and left the ruins of the infrastructure that I think my Uncle and father had that had made them Democrats, if you went on a list of all of the priorities that Robert Kennedy, that John Kennedy had, I would check every box. They were anti-war. They were anti-censorship. They were against the corporate control of our country. This corrupt merger of state and corporate power that now has emerged as a dominant governing model in our country. The Democratic Party has changed demographically. When I grew up in a Democratic Party, that was the party of the working class in our country, that was a party of small businesses, that was the party of the poor. In the last election, President Biden got roughly half of the country voting for him, but that half controlled 70% of GDP. And President Trump got about half the country voting for him, and that half represents about 30% of GDP. So we've had this inversion where the Democratic Party has become the party of wealth of elites. And I would say very insular elites. And the Republican Party is now the party of the poor, the working class. And it's been, you know, for me to watch that, I've been on the front lines of watching it.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Trusting government agencies is increasingly risky due to significant conflicts of interest, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Many decision-makers on committees are closely tied to the industries they regulate, raising questions about the integrity of recommendations that prioritize profit over public health. A concerning connection exists between the food industry and the pharmaceutical sector, creating incentives to maintain a health crisis among children, who represent a lucrative long-term market. The historical acquisition of major food companies by tobacco giants highlights a strategy to leverage addictive products, further exemplifying how profit motives overshadow the welfare of consumers.

Almost all the people, for example, on the on the food on the food committees at FDA are people who are part of the food industry. And the same is true on the pharmaceutical side. People are making decisions about what's good for you. Actually people are making huge amounts of profit on those recommendations and so you can't really trust the recommendations are Are in your best interest and you know what we know Is that? There is no more profitable There's no bigger profit center or industry in this country than a sick child And you know, they, and a sick child is a lifetime customer, a lifetime consumer, A very, very expensive product. And you have this alliance between a food industry and the pharmaceutical industry to keep our children sick, get them addicted. You know, in the seventies and eighties, um, the the tobacco industry was under attack and the two biggest tobacco companies run out and bought all the big food companies.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>RJR Nabisco you're referring to you.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah and Kraft and you know, you had Philip Morris buy Kraft and they took a lot of the scientists from the tobacco industry who were experts on making products addictive.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Innovation over cost efficiency is crucial for driving the evolution of technology, focusing on specialized features like a chip for AI on phones rather than device cost.
2. Creating unique interaction paradigms can enhance technology usage, such as improving voice interactions for a novel computer experience.
3. Analyzing ads that elicit emotions, like the Apple iPad ad with a hydraulic press, can lead to mixed reactions but highlight the importance of evoking emotions in advertising for product promotion.

### ‚ú® Summary
Innovation rather than cost efficiency drives the evolution of technology. Creating different and specialized features, such as a chip dedicated to powering AI on a phone, is more essential than making devices cheaper. The focus should be on developing unique interaction paradigms that utilize technology effectively, like enhancing voice interactions to provide a novel computer usage experience.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>We've been discussing ideas. But I don't like if I knew.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Is it that that it has to be more complicated or actually just much, cheaper and simpler?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, almost everyone's willing to pay for a phone anyway.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>So if you could make a way cheaper device, I think the barrier to carry a second thing or use a second thing is pretty high. So I don't think given that we're all willing to pay for phones, or most of us are, I don't think cheaper is the answer.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Different is the answer, Ben?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>Would there be a specialized chip that would run on the phone that was really good at powering a phone size AI model? Probably.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>But the phone manufacturers are going to do that for sure. That doesn't necessitate a new device.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think you'd have to find some really different interaction paradigm that the technology enables. And if I knew what it was, I would be excited to be working on it right now.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>You have voice working right now in the app. In fact, I set my action button on my phone to go directly to chat GPT's voice app. And I use it with my kids and they love it talking to it's got latency issues.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But it's really great. We'll get that we'll get that better. And I think voice is a hint to whatever the next thing is, like, if you can get voice interaction to be really good, it feels, I think that feels like a different way to use a computer.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The analysis of an Apple iPad ad that involved crushing creative tools with a hydraulic press led to mixed reactions. While some found it sad and ineffective in promoting the product, others viewed it as a potential representation of the innovation in creating a thin iPad. The ad's ability to evoke emotions was highlighted as a rare feat in the world of commercials, where most viewers tend to tune out.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Yeah, they were really fighting for. And I have to say, the overton window is opened back up. And I think it's great. All right. We got some things on the docket here. I don't know if you guys saw the Apple new iPad ad. It's getting a bunch of criticism. They use like some giant hydraulic press to crush a bunch of creative tools. EJ turntable trumpet, piano. People really care about Apple's ads and what they represent. We talked about that mother earth little vignette they created here. What do you think, Freiburg? Do you see the ad? What was your reaction to it? It made me sad.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It did not make me want to buy an iPad. So it made you sad. It actually elicited an emotion, meaning like commercials. It's very rare that commercials can actually do that. Most people just zone out. Yeah, they took all this beautiful stuff and heard it. It didn't feel good. I don't know. Just didn't seem like a good ad. I don't know why they did that. I don't get it. I don't know.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>I think maybe what they're trying to do is the selling point of this new iPad is that it's the thinnest one. I mean, there's no innovation left. So they're just making the devices thinner. So I think the idea was that they're going to take this hydraulic press to represent how ridiculously thin the new iPad is.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker expresses concerns about President Biden's leadership, mentioning that despite his past hard work and dedication, he seems to no longer be in charge. There are allegations of a lack of response and transparency from the White House, suggesting a calculated strategy to prevent challenges and maintain power. The speaker criticizes the unelected individuals influencing decisions and describes their actions as unethical and even diabolical. The focus is not on Biden's debate performance but on the need for a transition and celebration of his accomplishments rather than questionable tactics to uphold his position, which could be detrimental to his legacy.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Let me just start by saying that President Biden is a person that's given up his whole life to work on behalf of America in the best way that he thought was possible. He's overcome a lot of tragedies. I think he's worked very hard. He's diligently tried to do what he thought was right on behalf of the people of Delaware and then the United States. My honest takeaway is that that person, though, is no longer really in charge. And I think that that was very troubling for me, and it actually makes the last sort of six months make a lot more sense. So I thought the fact that we could not get a response from the White House to be... I took it a little bit actually personally. I was wondering why for someone that had been such an ardent supporter I couldn't even get an email back when I was consistently asking them to be on the And now I see that it wasn't just One single act, it was part of a holistic strategy. It was the same strategy that boxed RFK out of the Democratic primary. Because could you imagine if this event had happened when he had to debate RFK in the Democratic primaries, it would have been exposed then. It's probably to explain how the law has been used in New York State, whether you want to call it lawfare or not, but it was a very directed partisan action. And so all of these things are now three data points that are really important. You will not come on an open format show like ours to just speak openly. None of us were going to attack him or to corner him or box him in. You prevented other people from actually challenging you and directly asking questions of you in the Democratic primaries. And then you try to put political pressure on your opponents. All of that is systematically about a group of people that are unelected who are trying to control democracy. And I think that that's the most troubling takeaway from this. I don't think that you should take away from last night that Joe Biden had a bad debate. I think what we should take away is that there is a person who should be allowed to transition into the sunset and be celebrated for what he's done. And instead, there are people that, frankly, at the margins are acting pretty unethically, and at the limit is actually acting somewhat diabolically, to prop this person up so that They can keep power. For example, you've been in situations where you would expect the team that runs a company to be able to stand up and say the CEO is not in a position to run this company anymore. That's what you would expect if there's good governance and honesty. What was Ron Klain doing as an example when he was doing debate prep? Did he legitimately believe that Joe Biden was prepared for this or mentally capable of actually doing this? And the fact that they are allowing his legacy to be destroyed after 50 years, I think is really tragic.</blockquote>

### [35:16] Accountability and Fiscal Responsibility in Federal Programs


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (33:31 - 35:19)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/92bcae25-ec73-4f61-83e4-d00635e9c163)




### ‚ú® Summary
The United States is facing a fiscal crisis due to overextended debt, rapidly increasing interest expenses, and inefficient federal programs. It is crucial to hold all federal programs accountable for their performance annually and defund those that are ineffective. Prioritizing accountability and efficiency can help reduce the federal deficit below 7% of GDP. The call for the Democratic Party to focus on reason, results, and leadership to address the financial and social peril facing the nation is emphasized, with the potential for significant support from the public by taking such action.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I think I'll read the final paragraph of the email I sent to the Democratic Party leader a few months ago as a coda to this conversation. Here goes the United States is facing a fiscal crisis, the likes of which the world only sees every few hundred years as world leading nation states overextend themselves, take on unaddressable Debt loads, increase social programming, and eventually collapse under these conditions. The cost to service the interest alone on our federal debt is now greater than a trillion dollars per year. This already exceeds the discretionary defense budget. The debt service expense will only swell as interest rates are unlikely to decline back to 0%. And I do not subscribe to the easy to refute economic arguments of modern monetary theory. Simple arithmetic is all that's needed to discredit it. Furthermore, I can identify dozens of federal programs sponsored by Democrats that are not achieving their objectives. Yet we continue to fund them as if they were performing exactly as anticipated when originally conceived. Every federal program should be held to account for performance every year. If not, they should be defunded. Instead, I see the party pushing new programs that create new expense burdens without first addressing programs that simply aren't working. Accountability is a critical first step in reducing our federal deficit below 7% of GDP. I believe our nation is facing financial and thus social peril. I urge the party to become the quote, party of reason and results, put forward leaders that can lead, hold government programs that aren't working to account, make sure that every dollar Spent on social programming has a measurable impact and if they fail to deliver results cut them. The opportunity to be the party of reason and results is wide open. Myself and many of my friends would scramble for the opportunity to support that party. That's the end of my statement. And I think - Did you get a response? Then a month later, the handler said, so -and -so has this on their docket, they're going to call you, never going to call. Of course.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker is cautious about a company aiming to develop safe superintelligence due to concerns that the focus on safety may hinder their ability to move quickly and compete with established companies. The speaker highlights that prioritizing safety might slow down innovation rather than accelerate it. They mention a scenario where resources were withheld from a team at OpenAI to delay their progress, suggesting that safety-focused initiatives may not align with rapid development goals in the technology industry.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I have no idea. I don't know what these guys are doing. Have you guys looked at this company? I haven't seen anything. I'll ask that question. Reports. Yeah. Okay. A free bird, another assist.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Okay. Quick bounce pass to Zach. Zach. Yeah. Give us your opinion.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>The caveat what I'm about to say, by saying that I have not heard the pitch directly for this company I've only read what you've read in in the press that what they're trying to do is the Safe super intelligence and I'm not bullish about that pitch because I think it it makes the company a little bit schizophrenic it's working at cross purposes with itself on the one Hand you're a new company which means you're behind You've got to catch up with open AI or Google, these other companies that now have been creating, you know, models for years. So you've got to move very fast. On the other hand, you're saying you're going to basically make this very safe. Well, to be frank, safety concerns are a brake pedal. They don't help you move faster. They make you move slower.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, it's a government.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And in fact, I think that this is the main reason why Sam Altman either kicked these people out of the company or starved their resources until they left. Remember when a bunch of these people left OpenAI, they said that, hey, we were originally promised 30% of the computing resources by Sam, and then he reneged on that promise didn't Give us what we needed, so they all left. Well, I think that wasn't by accident.</blockquote>

### [57:08] Balancing Nationalism and Global Trade for Economic Growth


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (55:44 - 57:15)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/992284c2-47e7-4fe5-bb6e-6f079ae7c575)




### ‚ú® Summary
Policy and strategy play a key role in ensuring accountability in government programs by setting clear objectives and avoiding unnecessary expenditures. However, a nationalist and isolationist agenda may hinder global trade, leading to inflation due to limitations on importing goods and imposing tariffs. This inflation could burden everyday Americans by increasing the prices of products, especially those imported from countries like China. Maintaining the ability to trade with other nations is crucial for economic growth and controlling inflation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>But I think from a policy and a strategy perspective, he can have a really positive impact on the direction of the things that we talked about earlier, which is accountability in government Programs, having a clear set of objectives, making sure that we focus on those objectives and don't spend time and resources on things that are fluff, and perhaps aren't really meeting The objectives. The thing I do have concern about, I think that the nationalist agenda, the nationalism and the isolationism agenda, is counter to global trade, which can be deeply inflationary. And that is one concern I do have, which is the ability for the US to export and import with other trade partners around the world, I think is critical for us to continue to grow our economy And keep inflation down. So if we take policy action that limits our ability to import because we impose tariffs on other countries goods and services, it can be inflationary, makes things more expensive for Americans, everyday Americans to buy. When everyday Americans go into Walmart, and they buy products, a lot of those products are shipped from China. So if there's a tariff on those products, and the price of those products now goes up by 30, 40%, that can be a real burden that drives inflation. That's the point about the nationalism on manufacturing and inputs.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>So, Freiburg, you're pretty convinced at this point that a reciprocal trade agreement would cause inflation, hyperinflation?</blockquote>

### [58:54] Considerations of Introducing Tariffs on Imports


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (57:15 - 58:58)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d1b67040-8d33-43f0-b0c7-4a8f7a4e6379)




### ‚ú® Summary
Introducing tariffs on imports can drive prices up, which may align with strategic priorities such as security and reciprocity, as emphasized by President Trump. However, retaliatory tariffs from countries like China can harm domestic industries like agriculture, leading to the need for government subsidies. While onshoring manufacturing can be beneficial, it may come with challenges such as inflation and the requirement for significant investments.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>No, no, I think that the idea, the general statement, which I don't think is necessarily how this is being executed, I just want to make sure that we're all cognizant of the point that If you introduce and if you introduce tariffs on imports, it will drive prices up. Now, that may be the right thing to do from a policy perspective, as we heard from, from President Trump, when we interviewed him, his belief is that this is an important security state, That we use it to drive reciprocity, and we use it to hold China in check. And so that may be a more important strategic priority over the increase in the price of certain goods. The problem that will arise, and this happened during the last Trump administration, if China then responds with tariffs on the export of US agricultural products, so our biggest Buyer of agricultural products today is China, and then China put tariffs on our export, or they stopped buying from the US and they started buying from Brazil instead. The farmers are hurt. And when the farmers are hurt, the Trump administration had to spend money to support farmers, tens of billions of dollars. They subsidized they paid farmers in a way and so the federal government then has to step in to meet the gap that arises from what? Will end up becoming an escalating tariff problem or an escalating purchasing problem. So global trade Allows the economy to grow gives everyone a market you can start to trade, but there's also these security issues I do think it's important that we onshore a lot of manufacturing. I think it's important. But there's going to be a period of pain. There's going to be an investment needed. And it's not going to be simple and easy. And we may face quite a bit of inflation on the path to doing that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It gives an update here at the end of the show, Freeberg on scholarships and I've probably been asking for the own summit.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Socioeconomic background significantly influences educational opportunities and access to resources. Comparing students from vastly different environments‚Äîsuch as affluent areas versus disadvantaged inner-city or rural districts‚Äîhighlights the disparity in educational equity. A standardized score, like the SAT, does not fully capture the challenges faced by disadvantaged students, who may possess greater raw talent despite their circumstances. The discussion emphasizes the need for evaluating candidates based on their socioeconomic status alongside traditional metrics, advocating for broader hiring practices that include diverse educational backgrounds to foster inclusivity and recognize true potential.

I 100% agree. And I feel like I feel like we've used race as a heuristic for that conditional background. And that's what makes it hard because race is not necessarily it's certainly there's a correlation, but it's not necessarily indicative of the socio disadvantage that someone may Have faced and had to overcome in order to perform and succeed at the level that they could have given their conditions. And so I certainly think that the incorporation of one's socioeconomic background should be a critical part of the application process, and it's certainly in the same in the job setting, Ultimately.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I think, I think what would be much more valuable than all of this is for companies to hire from a whole bunch of different schools than they do today.</blockquote>

### [01:19:43] Beware the Tipping Point of Prosperity


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:18:29 - 01:19:41)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb0b59b9-636f-40f1-a544-d6f5b798cf97)




### ‚ú® Summary
A free economy drives prosperity through individual entrepreneurship, where individuals identify needs and create solutions that yield financial returns. However, a critical tipping point occurs when government employment comprises half or more of the workforce. At this juncture, the spirit of individual enterprise diminishes as government becomes the primary employer. The relationship between government spending and GDP suggests that as government outlays increase and approach 50% of GDP, individual liberties and incentives for entrepreneurship wane, leading to the mainstream acceptance of policies that may undermine economic freedom.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>And I think that that's why this set of policies, and I'm not talking about the tax on the centimillionaires, as much as a simple disregard for the fact that the United States, over time, The prosperity that we've realized, has been driven by a free economy by enterprising individuals going out and saying there are people that are asking for things. I'm going to figure out a way to build those things and make it for them and sell it to them. People will pay for it. They will work hard to do it and the incentive structure in a free market has enabled productivity improvements and enabled ultimately prosperity. But we've reached a tipping point and the tipping point is when half or more of the population begins to be employed by the government, at which point that concept is lost. Because now it is the government that is the employer, not one's own individual liberties and ability to go out and be enterprising. And so I think that the budget of government tipping to 50% of GDP is the reason why these policies become mainstream. That's my theory. And so it's a relationship of government spending, and a percent of total GDP, which translates into employment.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Do you guys- Very reasonable.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is not normal economic activity. No, no, no. We're anticipating the collapse of the Chinese into a lesser degree of the European industrial systems. So if we still want manufactured goods, we have to build the manufacturing plant. If you were to raise rates in that environment, would choke it off and we would be left with higher costs of living because of a lack of goods rather than because of inflation. And so basically we get the worst of all worlds. There's another reason why I'm not going to be needling the Federal Reserve to anything specific, and that's because the rules as we understand them are changing. Going back to the dawn of the first era of globalization that Columbus kicked off in 1500, economic activity on this earth has been based on more interaction, larger populations, more Interconnections, greater financial penetration, more markets, more technology, and the core of all of that is more people. Well, that's not happening anymore. Countries this is diverse as Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Germany, Spain, Poland, Russia. You know, they've all aged out. It's not that they're gonna die in the next year, although some of them are getting close, but they will never have larger populations again unless something really weird happens with Migration.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The next phase of European expansion raises questions about integrating less wealthy countries such as Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine. This expansion poses a different challenge as the traditional tools for funding and unifying Europe, such as bleeding the Russians to pay for Europe or using German economic strength, are no longer viable. The historical context of post-World War II Germany and France's motivations for European unification is no longer applicable in the current environment.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>About how many hull -itzers can you get to the line and what's your ammo flow and can your military industrial conflict start to stand up to the old Soviet weapons depot. It's a different series of questions that Europe wasn't designed for and if the next phase of European expansion is designed to cope with this, you're talking about bringing the countries In that are not nearly as wealthy. Moldova, Georgia, and most importantly, Ukraine, which would be from a population point of view, the largest country that the Europeans have absorbed since Britain in 1973. It's a very different proposition. And the tools that they have had to achieve everything that they've achieved to this point no longer exist. Remember back to that original deal of bleeding the Russians to pay for Europe, or the French version of Europe. Over time that evolved to pay for agricultural funds, for infrastructure funds, for economic development funds. Basically used German economic strength to pay for the unification of Europe. And the Germans went along with this not just because they were told to, but in the aftermath of World War II, we had two generations of Germans who were basically born saying, sorry, How can I make this right? And the French always had an idea. But that's not the environment we're in now.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Wiz rejected Google's $23 billion acquisition offer and plans to pursue an IPO instead.
2. The Mag 7 experienced a significant sell-off, impacting market dynamics.
3. Sam Altman's Universal Basic Income (UBI) study highlighted economic challenges and inflation concerns associated with large-scale implementation.
4. China is expanding its electricity production, with nuclear power costs significantly lower than in the US and EU, posing competitive challenges for the US.
5. The economic feasibility of UBI is questioned due to potential inflation and the preference for work-based income.

### [28:10] Challenges of Universal Basic Income


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (26:50 - 28:16)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bfc1b94e-3f07-487d-8a68-89cf3f0be9d1)




### ‚ú® Summary
Implementing Universal Basic Income on a large scale poses economic challenges, with $4 trillion annually being over 50% of the projected federal budget. This level of funding could lead to inflation due to the history of government-driven money causing bubbles and price increases. Despite the study highlighting micro, psychological, and social effects, the macro effects are clearly inflation and the difficulty of sustainable funding. Ultimately, the belief is that people prefer to work for their income, creating an inflationary cycle that makes universal basic income economically impractical.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And the second issue is just the net economic effect. If we gave 350 million Americans $1,000 a month, that's $350 billion a month. That's $4 trillion a year. Our prospective budget for next year is $7.3 trillion at the federal level. So, you know, that's already more than 50% of the total projected federal budget next year. Finding the mechanism for funding this at scale is not what this study actually looked at, because if you look at it, the net effect would be inflationary. And that's the third major reason is that ultimately, this would have an inflationary effect. Any time we've stimulated the economy with outside money, with government driven money, we see many bubbles emerge and we see an inflationary effect. So look at COVID, there were all these little bubbles that popped up in the financial markets. We had NFTs, we had crypto, we had all these sort of new places that money found its way to. And then we had an aggregate inflationary effect. Food prices are still up 30, 40% since COVID. And so net net I think that the study provides an interesting insight into the micro effects, the psychological effects, the social effects, but the macro effects are what is so like Simply arithmetically obvious, which is inflation, and an inability to actually fund this at scale. And fundamentally, people want to work. So they'll take that money, and they'll go find ways to work and generate more money. And you have this inflationary effect. So I think that net UBI does not make sense.</blockquote>

### [01:30:38] Power Costs Define Competitive Edge


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:29:20 - 01:30:42)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c6758702-1791-4292-ab4a-7088e4d97c44)




### ‚ú® Summary
China currently leads in electricity production capacity, poised to triple while the US aims to double its output. The cost of generating electricity in China is significantly lower, with nuclear power costing $65 per megawatt hour compared to $105 in the US and $140 in the EU. Additionally, building new electricity capacity in China is estimated to be five to ten times cheaper than in the US. This disparity emphasizes the long-term competitive challenges the United States faces, particularly as industries like AI increasingly depend on energy costs. The evolution of nuclear reactor technology, identified across four generations, further indicates the need for the US to address these industrial challenges in their energy landscape.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's a really important point. So currently, we have about a third of what China has. China is going to triple, we're going to double by Their cost is already lower than ours and it's going to get lower. And their cost to build out new electricity is a fraction of what it is in the US. So this is a massive difference. The International Energy Agency estimates that the electricity from nuclear power costs 65 bucks per megawatt hour in China, compared to 105 in the US and 140 in the EU. And recent data has US costs looking like they might be anywhere from five to up to 10 times what it costs to build out in China. So this is a real important long term competitive point. China has more electricity production, it's cheaper to make electricity and it's cheaper to build new capacity, and they're building at an accelerated rate. And this really highlights the industrial challenge. The United States is going to have in the decades ahead. We talk a lot about wanting to onshore manufacturing in the US, build out new manufacturing technologies, but ultimately, all of these industries, particularly AI, are going to be Driven by the cost of power. So, Nick, if you pull up this chart, so what's going on in nuclear? Well, there's effectively considered to be four generations of nuclear reactors. The first generation was all the early prototypes, and I've got an image up here to show this comes from the Department of Energy.</blockquote>

1. Regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley make it challenging for industries like financial services to compete or start up businesses, impacting economic growth
2. The US outperforms the UK, Canada, and Australia in economic performance due to factors like overspending capitalism, bailouts, and a strong AI and tech sector
3. Countries like America and Australia have been more successful at assimilating immigrants compared to many European countries, despite the controversy surrounding immigration
4. Crises drive governments to reform and make significant changes to improve economies, as seen in the case of Greece and Eastern European countries
5. China's growth is facing challenges like declining demographic advantage and increasing debt burden, leading to a projected growth rate of only 2% to 3% in the near future
6. Life improves with age as individuals reach their 40s and 50s, finding joy in simple things like nature, food, and relationships after perseverance through challenges in younger years

### ‚ú® Summary
In industries like financial services, compliance with regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley makes it challenging to compete or start up businesses. Despite a record number of new business applications, major industries have leveraged lobbyists to navigate regulations, while the majority of industries are burdened by over-regulation, stifling economic growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So it makes sense that certain industries, such as financial services where compliance, you know, Sarbanes -Oxley, whatever you want to, it just gets harder and harder and harder To compete, or to start up. My understanding is was there were more new business applications or permits filed last year than in history. And two, it does seem though that some of our biggest industries have figured out a way to weaponize government or weaponize lobbyists. But what you're saying is the majority of industries are over -regulated and this suppresses economic growth. Do I get that right? Absolutely.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The UK, Canada, Australia, and the US have varying economic performances with Canada being the worst over the last decade. The UK ranks poorly in terms of deficits and the number of zombie companies, even worse than the US. Despite issues like overspending capitalism and bailouts, the US performs relatively better due to its AI and tech sector which creates economic value and attracts global capital. America is seen as a beacon compared to these other nations.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, unfortunately, I think that UK doesn't rank well, you know, because as you rightly say that I, I maintain this ranking of these, you know, like of all these countries and you know Where they rank on these various metrics and in the Anglo -Saxon world, of course, the country that has been doing the worst, which I think, you know, like a bit of a surprise and I wrote About that is Canada. That's been the worst really of the last 10, 15 years. And then next comes UK, then Australia, and the US compared to these countries has been doing relatively better. And that's the irony of it. In terms of all the problems we've spoken about in America, but in terms of all the problems we spoke about in America, in terms of are much more severe in places like UK, that in terms of What it's been doing with its deficits, although America now has overtaken it in terms of what it's been doing in the number of zombie companies. So I'd say that in that regard, UK, in fact, ranks even worse than America on most metrics.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So it's really fascinating. Australia, Canada, the UK not doing well. So take them add in the US. Are we all guilty of overspending capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down, cronyism, bloated government, bailouts? But the difference is the US has AI and a tech sector that just, it creates so much economic value and draws capital from the rest of the world that at least props up or wallpapers over our Problems more so than those other three nations. What do you think?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Absolutely correct.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So that's the, that's my summary that, you know, which is the fact that, you know, like it just pains me that in terms of the fact that I don't even compare America to these other countries Because America is still the beacon for the world, right?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The Anglo-Saxon world, particularly America and Australia, has been more successful at assimilating immigrants compared to many European countries. Despite the economic benefits of immigration, it remains a controversial political issue that impacts social cohesion and may lead to stricter immigration policies in the future.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I think that, you know, as far as America is concerned, even though it's been a big problem in America and it's a big political issue, America has at least been better at assimilating Immigrants than a lot of European countries in that regard. And I think that countries like Australia and all have been pretty good in terms of as well. So I'd say that generally here the Anglo -Saxon world has been better than Europe in terms of a simulation of immigrants. But again, as I said that, you know, what is good economics is not always, you know, what's good politics, which is that even last year, like I was, I pointed out that immigration is what Really helped countries like America, avoid and bring inflation down much more than in other countries did last year. But the problem is the fact that it's become such a political issue about tearing apart the social fabric and stuff that what is good economics in obvious terms is not good politics and I don't see that changing. So I'd say that, yes, I think that immigration is out of control for many people out here in America. And so we're going to get a clampdown on that. Regardless, I think of what happens in November. But in general, I would say America and the Anglo -Saxon countries like Australia have done a better job at assimilating immigrants compared European countries like France.</blockquote>

It's Greece, right? Which is that this is a country which still 10 years ago was like an example of a complete, if I can say so, a basket case in terms of that. But just look at how well Greece has come back. It's booming now. It was again forced. This is what crisis does. It is one silver lining of a crisis. It's that it's the only time when governments reform or change things is when you have a crisis. So Greece runs out of money. It's on the verge of default. And then you end up getting a lot of reform. So Greece, I think, has been a comeback story. In fact, in general, the club -made countries of late have been doing better than their continental peers.

### [33:25] Challenges Facing China's Growth

### ‚ú® Summary
China's growth is facing significant challenges due to its declining demographic advantage and increasing debt burden. The country's growth engines, demographic growth, and debt accumulation, are no longer sustainable, leading to a projected growth rate of only 2% to 3% in the near future. China's negative population growth rate poses a significant obstacle to rapid growth, and the excessive debt accumulated over the years is becoming a burden, particularly in the property sector. While a crisis may not be imminent, China is experiencing a gradual decline in its growth rate.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But I've been bearish in China for a while now, because in terms of what's been happening to its boats, the two pillars of growth really, which is that it's been relying a lot on, you know, Like when China boomed, it had great demographics. And, of course, when the boom slowed down, it could still rely on taking on more and more debt to keep going. Those engines are now down. So I feel that China is in a circular decline. On a fundamental basis, I don't see China growing at a rate of more than 2% or 3% for the foreseeable future. So I'd say that, yeah, for now it seems that the risk of a blow up in China has, you know, sort of been papered over because they've again, done what it takes to keep the economy afloat. But the problem in China is the fact that they can't get away from the basic notion that there is no country in the world which is able to grow rapidly or even grow when it has a negative population Growth rate. That headwind is just very hard to overcome. And then second obviously is the debt issue in China, where China has took on so much debt over the last decade because it ambitiously wanted to keep its growth rate up. But now it's been forced to pay back that debt in a way with the property sector and all which took a lot of that debt in the doghouse. So I feel that, yeah, the China may not have a blowup or a crisis, but it's sort of going the way where the growth rate keeps slipping and sliding.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Cultures, income levels, the same thing. If on the Y axis you have happiness, and on the X axis you have age, happiness is a smile. Zero to 25, Star Wars prom making out, 25 to 45 are what I call the shit gets real years. Life is hard, money troubles, relationships, someone you love a great deal gets sick and die. I mean, life just hits you in the fucking face. It really does, you get beamed in the face. And you think, wow, this is harder than I thought. And what I can tell you is a lot of people out there are feeling the same way. And if you're a good person and you work hard, I'm not just saying everything will work out. You need to make sure you're not stuck, right? You're still working. Every night you're saying, what are the three, four things I gotta get done tomorrow? You're getting up, you're trying, you're showing up. You're asking others for help. You're expressing your emotions. And then when you're in your 40s and 50s, something wonderful happens. And that is you start to take, I don't know, you start to find joy in the most mundane things, nature, food, your friendships. So what I would tell you is if you're struggling in your 30s and 40s, I'm not suggesting just lay back and everything's gonna work out, that's bullshit. But what I can tell you is for the majority of people, it does get better. And again, if you're in your 30s and things are tough, you're kind of where you should be.

## Episode AI notes


1. Equality requires understanding individual differences rather than enforcing uniform treatment across the board.
2. Nuances in interactions based on gender, race, and cultural backgrounds significantly impact perceptions and consequences.
3. Merely advocating for equality without recognizing diverse identities can lead to misunderstandings and exacerbate issues like harassment.
4. Acknowledging and respecting diverse backgrounds is essential to fostering genuine equality.
5. Rising societal tensions may be reactions against identity politics, which can inadvertently deepen divisions rather than promote unity.

### [01:00:32] Equality Requires Understanding, Not Uniformity


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (58:48 - 01:00:31)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c251341c-a46f-436e-8640-bb702b3c3290)




### ‚ú® Summary
Treating people equally does not equate to treating everyone the same; the nuances in interactions based on gender, race, and cultural backgrounds significantly affect perceptions and consequences. Merely advocating for uniform treatment can lead to misunderstandings and exacerbate issues such as harassment, as individuals may respond differently to similar situations based on their identities. Acknowledging and respecting diverse identities and backgrounds is crucial, rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach to equality. Furthermore, the rising tensions in society may stem from reactions against perceived impositions of identity politics, which can unintentionally foster greater divisions and resentment rather than bridge them.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Right, because people, you know, I made a mistake in one of my companies on the maps, actually. And I used to think that treating people equally meant treating them the same, that if there was a woman, a man, black, white, orange, yellow, all the rules, everything had to be exactly The same. And then I had some people getting harassed because I wasn't paying attention to how everybody was being treated because saying something to a man versus saying something to a woman Can have two different meanings. And I didn't know this stuff was going on, right? I just told, I was just to treat everybody the same, treat them fairly. That's just not the way life You don't wanna be, you know, you want your vegetarian and family background to be respected, right? But if there's a lot of people here in this country that said red meat and beer, right? If you don't eat red meat, there's something wrong with you.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>See, I don't really, to me, Mark, that country is the America I know I mean look my view is my you know, I mean you should free country.

So this is what I think you did. I think you did a lot of this. Yeah, I'm seeing all the shit that's going on.

### ‚ú® Summary
Utilizing popular culture references and humor in marketing can significantly enhance product visibility and engagement. Creating a visually appealing and relatable video can lead to viral success when shared on major platforms like Hacker News and Reddit, attracting early adopters and building an initial user base effectively. The combination of clever content and strategic distribution is crucial for generating interest and momentum in a new product.

And then they really also, this is the other core of the product on the distribution and marketing business side. They decide that they're going to throw in some like, allusions to, you know, popular culture memes in the video. So like a bunch of the files that they're syncing are like, you know, they've got some Tom Cruise images. They've got Steve bomber with his tongue out, like all this stuff. It's funny watching it now. Like, I don't even remember what half these things are referring to. And and so then they they make the video and then they post the video on hacker news on Reddit, which Reddit had been in the first batch of Y Combinator. I think the first batch and and dig, which was dig was huge at the time. The video goes viral. And then that's how they get their waitlist for for their first users.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And then it's just such a clear, clear video.

### ‚ú® Summary
In the competitive landscape of cloud storage solutions, user experience stands out as a crucial determinant of success. Companies struggled to define their offerings due to inconsistent product features and market positioning, particularly in the face of rapid changes from larger players like Google and Microsoft. Dropbox achieved remarkable success by prioritizing a seamless user experience, outperforming its competitors who often fail to deliver the same level of reliability and usability. Even recent changes from Google have negatively impacted user satisfaction, highlighting that consistent and straightforward functionality remains key to retaining customer loyalty.

### ‚ú® Summary
Dropbox exemplified the go-go years of tech by developing a product that excels in markets where competitors falter. Its viral distribution model and innovative freemium mechanics fueled its success, enabling user collaboration to naturally spread the product. Additionally, Dropbox implemented gamified incentives whereby users earned free storage for inviting others, enhancing engagement and driving referrals. This strategy turned users into enthusiastic advocates, effectively increasing user acquisition through a blend of social sharing and tangible rewards.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The new mafia. But anyway, back on track, this is really like the start of the go-go years for Dropbox. So we talked a little bit earlier about, you know, it's got this product that just works when nothing else on the market does. It also has this amazing viral distribution and freemium mechanics that they put in place, where both you use Dropbox to collaborate like we're doing on this podcast. And so it naturally virally spreads the product. But they also put in place this kind of gamified incentive to do so, so that everybody that you share Dropbox with who signs up for the product, you get more free storage.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>This works so hard on me. Like I was a referral maniac to get more space. And I think it was 250 meg per person who signed up for an account that you invited.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Which back in the day was a lot of storage.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Dropbox exemplifies the effectiveness of the freemium model, where a vast majority of users remain non-paying but enable substantial revenue growth from a small paying segment. Despite only 2.2% of half a billion users paying, the company achieved $300 million in free cash flow, underscoring the profitability of the model. The operational structure remains lean, focused primarily on engineering rather than sales or marketing, facilitating high efficiency and minimal operational overhead. This strategy not only allows for rapid user acquisition through viral dynamics but also highlights the potential oversight in traditional product design approaches, as seen in the miscalculation by industry leaders like Steve Jobs.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it was crazy. And it worked so well. Most of us still to this day, the vast majority of Dropbox users don't pay them anything or just free users. But the small percentage who do just the number of users are so big, they make so much money. All throughout this, Dropbox is just raking in cash. They're massively cash flow positive, even as a young startup.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>To give you as a sense today, we'll get to these numbers. But today, half a billion people have accounts. And 2.2% of them are paying. So it really is that that, you know, tried and true freemium model.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yep. And even with that very small percentage, last year, Dropbox made 300 million in free cash flow. That's cash flow profits, not revenue, which is incredible. So I'll do this. The company is super lean. It's like an engineer's dream. They're only about 20 employees at the company through like 2011, 2012, the first few years. They're all engineers. There's nobody, you know, no business folks there.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It's just this, this viral and referral dynamic that's like, that's also the nice thing about having the operating system be your user interface. I mean, shy of like a very basic web interface, they basically don't have to do any product design other than really like system design and then engineering that system.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yep. And this leads to one of, if not, the probably biggest error of Steve Jobs's career, of which there weren't that many of them where he sees this.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In today's fundraising landscape for startups, acquiring significant capital inevitably leads to increased spending. Companies like Dropbox, once characterized by their lean operations, face challenges when transitioning to a high-funding environment. Despite having a great product, suitable market fit, and effective viral distribution, Dropbox's ambitious plans were undermined by a lack of a robust and cohesive business strategy. Their situation illustrates that financial resources alone are insufficient for sustained success; a solid strategy is crucial for leveraging those resources effectively.

### ‚ú® Summary
App developers often face significant challenges when competing against platform providers like Android and iOS. While third-party tools can provide unique solutions, established platforms offer native tools that can be difficult to surpass. Dropbox's successful model stemmed from a distinct use case that filled a specific need, highlighting that meaningful competition within a niche is possible, but generally, competing directly with major platforms leads to unfavorable outcomes. This insight underscores the importance of finding unique market opportunities rather than directly challenging established providers.

Or I could just use this third party.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I mean, the biggest issue was that at Dropbox at this point, you know, as an organization was trained that they can beat the platform provider because their killer use case of it's A folder on your computer that sinks and it sinks everywhere, just nailed it so hard that you get bold and you decide that even though these platform providers have all these things for Developers and we can do better and we can build the tool chain they want. And it's much, much harder competing with the platform itself when you're down at the developer level. And really, in most cases, if you look at anybody that's trying to be a better voice assistant, you lose unless you're the home button on iOS, you know, there's competing with the platform Is always difficult and Dropbox found one little tiny wedge into where you can actually meaningfully compete.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, and I think it's to pull forward a tech theme here, as we so often do on this show, I</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
A strategic refocus on core customer needs and a decisive cut of underperforming projects enabled a turnaround for the company. Transitioning from AWS to in-house data centers drastically reduced costs, enhancing profitability. Despite a period of cashflow negativity, the company rebounded to become highly cashflow positive, generating over $300 million in free cashflow by doubling revenue while simultaneously lowering expenses.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>He ran Motorola within Google. He was like kind of a turnaround guy taking like stuff that was struggling or stuff that Google brought in like Motorola for other reasons, turning it around, making it work. They cut all this stuff. They kill mailbox, they kill Carousel, they kill the developer platform, they way scale back the enterprise aspect of Dropbox for business. And they refocus on the core customer base. So this was 2016. And once they do that, things really turn around. They've always been cashflow positive, but during those years, they actually dip down into cashflow negative. They become back to hugely cashflow positive. As we mentioned last year in 2017, they generate over $300 million of free cashflow. A big part of that, and part of the doubling down is over the last couple of years, they've transitioned off of AWS. So for most of Dropbox's life, it was all running on S3 in AWS. They decide to build their own data centers and bring it all in house. And their cost of goods sold goes way down. So even though revenue basically doubles over the last couple of years, the cost of goods sold actually goes down from where it was at the lower revenue base. And this massively improves the company. Yeah.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Consciousness involves the illusion of stable visual inputs, where images shift at the level of visual consciousness despite stable input to the nervous system.
2. Challenges to physicalism are seen in quantum mechanics, with concepts like entanglement and non-locality questioning traditional physicalist principles.
3. Functionalism theory suggests that replicating functions related to intelligence and consciousness on a machine may lead to the emergence of consciousness, a belief prevalent in the tech industry and among computational scientists.
4. Exploration of metaphysical stances like idealism arises in response to the limitations of physicalism in explaining consciousness, with experiences of interconnectedness prompting this exploration.
5. Physicists are striving for a unified theory that explains everything, grappling with the role of the observer in constructing reality and shifting towards idealism from physicalism.

### ‚ú® Summary
In an experiment where different images are projected to each eye, the conscious experience involves seeing one image and then shifting randomly to the other image. Despite the stability of the inputs to the nervous system, with one input to each eye, the conscious phenomenology involves a constant shifting between the two images. This shifting occurs at the level of visual consciousness while there is no change in the input received by the eyes or the nervous system from the retina onward.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So just to clarify for listeners who haven't, who may not be able to visualize this, you have one image projected to one eye and a different image to the other eye and your conscious experience Tends to, if it's set up correctly, is you're simply seeing one of the images and then it just randomly shifts to the other image. And it's something over which you can't control the shift. And what's interesting about this experimentally is that the inputs to your nervous system are completely stable. I mean, all you have are these two inputs to one to each eye, and nothing is changing, and yet at the level of your conscious phenomenology, there is this very bizarre shifting back and Forth between seeing one image and then seeing the other, and then seeing one image and then seeing the other. And it's, this was a wholesale change in the contents of visual consciousness, and yet there's zero change at the level of the eyes. At the bottom of your nervous system from the retina onward.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Physicalism faces challenges at its core when attempting to define the universe, as seen in quantum mechanics where concepts such as entanglement and non-locality defy traditional physicalist principles. The notion that reality depends on observation raises questions about the adequacy of physicalism in explaining the nature of the universe.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You're entirely right. My dog doesn't understand general relativity or the stock market or election. My dog is a perfectly intelligent member of a species that survived for millions of years, but certain things are cognitive beyond it, and maybe this is also beyond us. But now the additional evidence for physicalism being inadequate, namely at the bottom, at the rock bottom of physicalism is how do we define the physical. And if you listen to anything in quantum mechanics over the last 30 years, like we all know, it's deeply troubling and it's very difficult to define what is the physical. And the fact the physical includes such bizarre things as two particles that are entangled, that are at opposite ends of the universe if you observe one and determine its state instantaneous, Instantaneous the state of the other one is determined. You're talking about non -locality. Non -locality. So what sort of, I mean, what sort of physicalism is that if things are entangled across the universe? That's certainly not my grandfather. That's certainly not Dem, you know, Adams and the Voight. And then, you know, now turns out that the entire school of physics, you know, that does what's called contextuality or called first person physics, right, where it is where they accept As a fact, as an observation, as an empirical fact, that what exists really depends on what you measure. And if you have different measurement protocols, different things, you measure different things that weren't there before. So the mere act of observing, the participatory universe, the mere act of observing creates reality. Well, how does that sit with standard of physicalism?</blockquote>

### [37:48] Functionalism and Consciousness Replication


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (37:00 - 37:49)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36a025c0-25b4-4c9d-b7ab-f253727dd17a)




### ‚ú® Summary
Functionalism theory suggests that everything, including intelligence and consciousness, has a function such as enabling planning. Replicating these functions on a machine through Turing functionality or computational functionalism may lead to the machine possessing properties, including consciousness. This belief is prevalent in the tech industry and among computational scientists, and with the rise of LLMs, the general public also assumes that such machines will eventually attain consciousness.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Based on some version of functionalism, i .e. That everything has a function, clearly that's true for intelligence, consciousness also has a function, you know, enable planning or, you know, long -term planning, short -term Planning, summary of the current situation that's ongoing in my body, whatever it may be, it has a one or more function. And once you replicate those functions, in particular on a tuning machine, right, this is called Turing functionality or computational functionalism, then that machine will have All of the properties, including consciousness. So that's a deep belief, particularly in the tech industry and among computational scientists. And now, of course, with LLMs, it's risen to the level of the general public that people assume, yeah, these things sooner or later will be sent in, will be conscious.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker describes an experience of losing oneself and becoming part of the world, feeling interconnected with everything. This profound feeling prompts the exploration of metaphysical stances like idealism in response to the challenges posed by quantum mechanics and physicalism's inability to explain consciousness.

You lose self, no more self, you lose, you know, the entire external world is all gone. And you feel like the only thing that was in my plenum was sort of this star -studded galaxy filled field. And somehow you, I mean, when I say you, there isn't an eye anymore. There isn't a you this, it just feels that you become part of everything. I mean, this is the title of my book, then I myself the world, I did statement from from Tristan and his older second act, where they become, you know, they become each other and become Part of the world, where you really, I was my feeling. I know it's just a feeling. I know it sounds voodoo, but that's... And it stayed with me, this experience of being one or accessing this cosmic mind that possibly analyzes everything. And that really, together with the inability of physicalism to explain consciousness, together with this challenge that quantum mechanics now poses to our notion of what is physical, Really prompts me more and more to look at states, to look at metaphysical stance like idealism. And as you just pointed out, IIT is not the same, but it's related to that.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Physicists are grappling with the crisis at the foundation of physics, including the concept of the active role of the observer in constructing reality. There is a shift from physicalism towards idealism, and the desire to create a comprehensive theory that explains everything is inherent in human nature.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's not how we can get at the science.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's correct. However, as a physicist, you cannot help the struggle as a intelligent person. You cannot be helped by the fact that there is this crisis at the foundation of physics, that many, or at least a significant number of physicists are thinking about the active role of The observer in constructing what we call reality, which is certainly one step away, certainly a huge step away from physicalism towards idealism. Of course, we always have this desire, this dream, maybe it's not wise, but to try to construct a single theory that explains everything. That's just inherent in human nature. I was recently reading an Ernst Mach, who was a phenomenologist and a physicist to boot.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The tribal component of inclusivity, unity, and reliance on one another in a group setting provides a sense of belonging and purpose. Human connection is highly valuable as it is deeply ingrained in human nature. The need for collaboration and community is supported by neurochemical factors like oxytocin, fostering a sense of well-being and satisfaction among individuals. Historical examples suggest that individuals throughout history have been drawn to tribal settings and cultures, emphasizing the importance of human connections over individual survival.

Like maybe that's actually what's intoxicating. And you come back to safe America. And yeah, of course, it's great to not get shot at anymore, etc, etc. And again, we're blessed to live in those circumstances. But there is a real human loss.

We survive in groups, and we have a lot of sort of neurochemical reinforcement of those oxytocin and all these other hormones that make us feel good when we're collaborating in a group. And so I realized that Ellis was right, and I looked back into the history books, and indeed along the frontier, the Pennsylvania where my ancestors settled in the 1780s all the way up Through the Midwest and the West and the Southwest, young men and sometimes young women would run off and join the native culture or even if they had native society and even if they'd Been kidnapped during raids, if often they didn't want to go home, they wanted to go back, right?

### ‚ú® Summary
Choosing to live in a mixed-income, mixed-race neighborhood fosters a sense of community and collaboration. During Hurricane Sandy, a low-income building in New York's Lower East Side displayed remarkable communal support and interrelatedness, with residents looking out for one another and sharing resources like a mother obtaining a machete to protect the building from break-ins.

And the building that I live in with my wife and two little girls before I was in there during Hurricane Sandy. There was an extraordinary example of this sort of communality that you would get in a poor neighborhood and I think not in a rich one. Hurricane Sandy shut off the lights in New York City, 34th Street and below. So at nighttime it was quite frightening in Manhattan, actually gangs of young men roaming around and all kinds of quasi -apocalyptic filming scenes. So in this particular building, it's a tenement building and mostly Spanish speaking and a lot of interrelatedness between the apartments, cousins and uncles and what have you. One of the mothers, Dominican or Puerto Rican, I'm not sure which, got a machete because they were worried about break -ins because a lot of the people who had children had to leave the Building because there was no water, there was no running water.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The development of AI clusters and accelerators is rapidly growing with forecasts of a $400 billion AI accelerator market by 2027. Companies are investing in trillion-dollar AI clusters, focusing on advancements like GPT models. The challenge lies in determining if these forward-looking investments will pay off, with the necessity to invest in building complete clusters rather than just renting them for short periods.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think like six months ago, you know, 10 gigawatts was the taco town. I mean, I think, I feel like now, you know, people have moved on, you know, 10 gigawatts is happening. You know, there's the information report on opening eye and Microsoft planning a $100 billion cluster. So you got to, you know, if you go out or is that the 10 gigawatt? I mean, I don't know. But, you know, if you try to like, map out, you know, how expensive would the 10 gig of what cluster be, you know, that's maybe a couple hundred billion. So it's sort of on that scale. And they're planning it. They're working on it. You know, so, so the, you know, it's not just sort of my crazy take. I mean, AMD, AMD, I think forecasted a $400 billion AI accelerator market by 27. You know, I think I think it's, you know, an AI accelerator is only part of the expenditures. It's sort of, you know, I think sort of a trillion dollars of sort of like total AI investment by 2027 is sort of like we're very much in track on it. I think the trillion dollar cluster is going to take a bit more sort of acceleration. But, you know, we saw how much sort of chat GPT only, right? And so like every generation, you know, the models are going to be kind of crazy and people, it's going to shift the over to window. And then, and then, you know, obviously the revenue comes in, right? So these are forward looking investments. The question is, do they pay off? Right. And so if we sort of estimated the, you know, the GPT four cluster at around 500 million, by the way, that's sort of a common mistake people make. As they say, you know, people say like $100 million, 54. But that's just the rental price, right? They're like, ah, you rent the cluster for three months. But it's, you know, if you're building the biggest cluster, you got to like, you got to build the whole cluster. You got to pay for the whole cluster. You can't just rent it for three months.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>We can't.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But they, I mean, really, you know, once, once you're trying to get into the sort of hundreds of billions, eventually you got to get to like 100 billion a year.

### ‚ú® Summary
The concept illustrated discusses the idea that in integrating systems, sometimes utilizing overkill, such as advanced AGI technology, can simplify the transition process and maximize gains. Although intermediate systems could enhance productivity for a software engineer, the likelihood of their adoption is uncertain. However, utilizing more advanced AGI technology could provide the capacity to automate cognitive tasks, essentially replacing the need for a software engineer.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's like, you know, we're in an SF and so we missed that or whatever. Um, but I think in some sense, um, you know, the way a lot of these systems won't be integrated is, is you kind of get the sort of sonic boom where it's, um, you know, the sort of intermediate Systems could have done it, but it would take and schlep. And before you do the schlep to integrate them, you get much more powerful systems, much more powerful systems that are sort of on hobbled. And so they're this agent and there's drop in remote worker. And, um, you know, and then you're kind of interacting with them like a co-worker, right? You know, you can take do zoom calls with them and you're slacking them. And you're like, ah, can you do this project? And then they go off and then, you know, go away for a week and write a first draft and get feedback on them and, uh, you know, run tests on their code. And then they come back and then, and then you see it and you tell them a little bit more things or, you know, and, and, and that'll be much easier to integrate.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Um, and so, um, you know, it might be that actually you need a bit of overkill to make the sort of transition easy and to really harvest the gains. What do you mean by the overkill? Overkill on the model capabilities? Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So basically the intermediate models could do it, but it would take a lot of slap. And so then, you know, the, like, actually it's just the drop in remote worker kind of AGI that can automate, you know, cognitive tasks that actually just ends up kind of like, you know, Basically it's your like, you know, the intermediate models would have made the software engineer more productive, but you know, will the software engineer adopted? And then, you know, 27 model is, uh, well, you know, you just don't need the software engineer. You can literally interact with it like a software engineer and it'll do the work of a software engineer.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So the last episode I did was with John Schulman.

### ‚ú® Summary
A superintelligence could lead to a perfectly loyal military and security force, eliminating rebellions and popular uprisings with tools like perfect lie detection and surveillance. This could prevent dissent and challenges to the system, hindering the evolution of ideas and limiting pluralism. The potential for a dictatorship with an unchanging truth enforced by super intelligence is concerning.

You know, you have a perfect lie detection. You know, you have a surveillance of everybody. You know, you can perfectly figure out who's the dissenter, weed them out. No Gorbachev would have ever risen to power, who had some doubts about the system. No military coup would have ever happened. And I think you, I mean, I think there's a real way in which, you know, part of why things have worked out is that, you know, ideas can evolve. And you know, there's sort of like some, some sense in which sort of time heals a lot of wounds and time, you know, solve solves, solves, you know, a lot of debates and a lot of people had Really strong convictions. But you know, a lot of those have been overturned by time because there's been this continued pluralism and evolution. I think there's a way in which kind of like, you know, if you take a CCP like approach to kind of like truth, truth is what the party says. When you supercharge that with super intelligence, I think there's a way in which that could just be like locked in and trying for, you know, a long time. And I think the possibilities are pretty terrifying.</blockquote>

I think in the US, you know, there's all these like amazing high schools and like sort of an appreciation of excellence. And in Germany, there's really this, um, sort of like Paul Poppy syndrome. That's right. Where it's, um, you know, you're the curious kid in class and you want to learn more instead of the teacher being like, ah, that's great. They're like, they kind of resent you for it. And they're like trying to crush you. And, um, I mean, there's also like, there's no kind of like elite universities for undergraduate, which is kind of crazy. Um, um, so, you know, the sort of, you know, there's sort of like, basically like the meritocracy was kind of crushed in Germany at some point. Um, also, I mean, there's this sort of incredible sense of, you know, complacency. Um, you know, across the board, I mean, one of the things that always puzzles me is like, you know, even just going to a US college was this kind of like radical act. And like, you know, it doesn't seem radical to anyone here because it's like, ah, this is obviously the thing you do and you can go to Columbia, you go to Columbia, but it's, you know, it Is very unusual. And it's, it's, it's wild to me because it's like, you know, this is where stuff is happening. You can get so much of a better education and, you know, like America's were, you know, it's where, where, where all the stuff is. And, um, people don't do it. And, and so, um, yeah, anyway, so I, you know, I skipped a few grades and, and, uh, you know, I think, um, at the time it seemed very old. I mean, to kind of like go to college and come to America, I think, um, you know, now, one of my sisters is now like turning 15, you know, and so then I, you know, and I look at her and I'm like, Now I understand how my mother is.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And then so you get to call, you're like presumably the only 15 year old.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker questions the logic behind rebelling against elitism as a counterreaction from the atrocities committed by the Nazis. They suggest that this rebellion could stem from a response to issues related to race and international relations, such as the aftermath of World War I and II. The severe consequences imposed on Germany after World War II, with cities destroyed, the population displaced, and strict measures enforced, could have influenced the subsequent reactions and ideologies.

I mean, I also just think there is a certain amount in what a certain, I mean, look at sort of World War I and of World War I was in World War II for Germany, right? And sort of, you know, a common narrative is that the piece of Versailles, you know, was too strict on Germany. You know, the piece imposed after World War II was like much more strict, right?

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Search, the most profitable business in history, will be replaced by answers. Spreadsheets and browsers will be replaced by agents. Apps and programs will be mutable, evolving code organisms raised by other agents. According to Energy Conference keynote speaker, Bill Gates, quote, agents will affect how we use software as well as how it's written. They'll replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity apps. Businesses that are separate today, search advertising, social networking, with advertising, shopping, productivity software, will become one business, unquote. Sam Altman believes that compute will be, quote, the currency of the future, unquote, the world's most precious commodity. In the 21st century, humanity has added a new page to physics, a new form of energy, compute.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So one of the things about Berlin that also I thought was really brilliant that they do not allow cell phones in any of these spaces. They'll put a sticker over your camera. If you whip that thing out, you are out. You're out right away. And it really makes spaces feel different to have people not be on their phones. Berghain, its roots are as a gay club and its real roots are as like a really profoundly dirty gay sex club. And I say dirty without judgment. There's one section that is still devoted to that that is easier to get into, but the dress code for a Friday night is socks. So I didn't go. But even the main club is like it's really, it's like a space that's devoted to that. And so you already feel like an interloper and the rule is sort of like, this is a place where adults can do whatever they want and where they're guaranteed privacy and nobody talks about It. It's basically like German culture is realized they really don't like surveillance for very specific historical reasons. I found it to be like an entirely, oh, this just makes me sound like such a kook, but like, I always like this place is profound. Like it feels profound to be in a place where I don't know, really dedicated to complete self -expression where nothing that happens gets judged. I mean, I went on a Sunday afternoon. It was like 2 p .m. There were Berliners there who were just, that was their Sunday, that's what they always do. Aren't people who wait in line. There were people who probably have been waiting for eight hours and just gotten in and were so excited. I saw more expression of ways a human body could look or be dressed than I've seen in my whole life. And there were things that were happening that were like very burgheiny. Like they have something called a dark room, which is a room you can go in that's very under lit where people can do what they want to do to each other, usually gay But there's also like, They have an ice cream parlor. I had a really nice sorbet.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And a cappuccino.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The best and the brightest, should I say that? The best and the brightest become PhD students oftentimes in the United States if they have access. The richest kids in the world come to US universities. I say the first day of class at Stern, make friends with all the foreign students because their father owns the soccer team in Ecuador or wherever. But basically all the foreign students, we talk about diversity in graduate schools. That's bullshit. We let them in because they pay full freight because their dad is or their mother. Is ridiculously fucking rich. So when you meet the kids from Brazil, eight, they loved a party. They're the funnest, hang out with them. But also they're going to be the most fun to hook up with in Rio because dad owns the biggest hotel chain in Sao Paulo and Rio. Anyways, we let in, we attract just this incredibly diverse, interesting, rich to be blunt and also freakishly remarkable kids into the PhD program. The PhD students at these universities are just incredible. So you're surrounded by prosperity and achievement and professors who have their issues but are generally speaking, some of the brightest people in the world trying to do good work. And coming out of college, if you were just to look at your phone all day long, you might think, wow, I'm kind of fucked or this is, I'm entering into a world that is not a very nice place. And that just could not be less true. Right? What's going on in the Middle East or in Ukraine?</blockquote>

### [12:15] Paths to Socialism: A Debate within Marxism


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (10:16 - 12:12)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2c0be8b-a4e6-4bb9-bf80-efa0305ab936)




### ‚ú® Summary
Marxism debates whether all peoples follow a universal path to socialism or have diverse paths. Early Chinese communism believed in multiple paths to socialism, viewing minority groups as underdeveloped needing education before adopting modern family norms. They were hostile to traditional Chinese culture, waging a culture war against practices like ancestor worship and burial, and Mandarin Chinese was adopted over Cantonese. Early Chinese communism was anti-Chinese nationalist, contrasting with the current Chinese Communist Party's strong Chinese nationalist stance.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. So it comes to an in -house debate within Marxism about whether the progress of true socialism is a universal thing experienced by all peoples in a similar path, or whether different Peoples and cultures might have different paths to Marxism. The Chinese variety of Marxist governments adopted the view that there could be multiple paths to true socialist liberation, and that the minority groups were underdeveloped. And so they needed to have other forms of education development first, and then they could have modern family norms. In particular, early Chinese was uniquely hostile to traditional Chinese culture. They waged really an intense culture war on traditional Chinese forms of burial, ancestor worship, traditional Chinese religion. Early Chinese communism was in some sense very anti -Chinese nationalist. Even the adoption of Mandarin Chinese as a language. Mandarin is a hybrid language of traditional Chinese and basically Manchu, which was a foreign dialect. Whereas a more historically exclusively Chinese language like Cantonese, which was a candidate for a national early on, was passed over. So it's important to understand that early Chinese communism was kind of anti -Chinese nationalist, whereas today the modern variety of the CCP is very Chinese nationalist. There's been a radical change in their view of culture, traditional Chinese culture in the place of the Han Chinese nation within the people's Republic.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Skills-biased technical change has led to a significant structural shift in modern economies, creating greater economic rewards for skills and experience. This has resulted in young individuals facing more economic challenges when considering family formation, leading to a sense of precarity and hindered ability to have children. While there have been improvements for young women due to decreased discrimination in the workforce, the overall trend has caused people to lag behind their desires for starting a family.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I think there's basically elements of this question of kind of the emergence of a low fertility norm even in societies that didn't have the government, you know, aggressively reducing Fertility. And the first one is there's just been this big structural change across like every economy. It's called skillsbiased technical change. And basically what it means is modern economies are complicated. They create bigger rewards to skills and experience. Like in the past, the amount of economic gain you got from more years in school or more years of experience was relatively modest. Whereas today, the economic gain to more schooling and more years of experience is quite large. And so that means that young people who are in the years where you really want to be doing like family formation, marrying and having kids are in much worse economic situations relative To other people in society. And so they feel worse off. So they feel more precarious and less able to have children. And that's particularly true for young men. Young women have had a little more improvement over time, which, you know, is because of a diminishment and discrimination against women in the workforce, which great, wonderful, Love it. But at the same time, we do have this challenge that there's been a side effect of people falling behind their own family desires. So that's the first factor, skills bias, technical change, it happened everywhere. Some societies adapted a little bit better than others, but it's happened everywhere. The second one is to just have a little honesty about our own society.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Low fertility rates are likely to negatively impact wage growth as fewer young people will lead to slower wage growth. Older populations typically have lower rates of innovation and productivity growth, affecting patenting, business formation, new product adoption, and requiring more labor in low productivity sectors. As societies age, wage growth is expected to decline, resulting in an underperforming tax base.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And because of that forecast, they have a fairly rosy forecast for the outlook for Social Security. And they also have this problem that they assume that low fertility will have no effect on the pace of wage growth in our society. The problem with this is if we know anything about wage growth, it's that younger people have faster wage growth. So if fertility is low and you have fewer young people, then wage growth will slow down. We also know, I've actually written a paper summarizing the evidence on this, that older populations have lower rates of innovation and productivity growth. That is, they don't patent as much, they don't form businesses as much, they're slower to adopt new products, they require more of labor to be devoted to low productivity growth sectors Like human care, they're just less innovative. And this isn't pejorative, okay? I don't expect, would be unreasonable to say I expect a 70 year old To be as economically innovative and productive as a 13 year old. Okay, that would that would be a grossly unfair expectation of that person Um, and so as societies age we can actually expect that wage growth will decline And as a result the tax base Will underperform. So if you look at something like Social Security, they're not only forecasting excessively high fertility, they are correspondingly assuming</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Policies to encourage fertility can be categorized into three main areas. Firstly, policies should fix what's broken by addressing issues like discouraging marriage within programs such as EITC, SNAP, and Section 8 housing vouchers. Secondly, providing financial support for parents to raise children is crucial as it is socially valuable work that benefits society in the long run. Lastly, changing rules such as allowing more flexible land use, reducing unnecessary labor regulations like occupational licensing, and challenging societal norms that limit access to opportunities can positively impact fertility rates by reducing the costs associated with raising children and enabling individuals to make choices that support their desire to have children.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But there are lots and lots of policies that nudge a little bit each. And we can put them broadly in three buckets. One is fix what's broken. So I mentioned the EITC. The EITC currently discourages marriage. Marriage has a huge causal effect on birth rates. So we need to fix the discouragement of marriage. That means fixing programs like the EITC or SNAP or Section 8 housing vouchers, making them removing marriage penalties and removing any fertility penalties in them. So fix what's broken. Pay for it. So we should give people money to have kids because raising children is socially valuable work. It's not a handout. When parents raise a child who is a functional citizen, they are doing hundreds of thousands of dollars of labor that is transferred to taxpayer through future tax revenues.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I want to come back to the question, but before we get to that, what was your third one, the third area policy?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And then the third one is we should change the rules. So there are places where we don't have to pay for things, but we can change rules, things like allowing more flexible use of land that people own. Right now, we greatly restrict people's property rights to the use of their land to build houses or build more houses on that land. Housing is the single biggest cost of raising children. And so if we build more of it, we know from good, high quality, causally informative studies that making housing cheaper gets you more babies. And there's other places, occupational licensing, where we have unnecessary labor regulations that prohibit people from being a hairdresser until they complete some, you know, Absurd number of hours of schooling. There's all kinds of places where we have rules in our society, legal rules or normative rules. You must have a college degree to do this job. Well, really? Do you need a college degree for that job? Where we force people to delay their lives or we prevent people from accessing or using their own rights and property in ways that reduces fertility.</blockquote>

### [13:43] Priorisierung und Handeln

### ‚ú® Summary
Wahlen bieten die Chance zur Neupriorisierung der politischen Agenda. Migration ist ein zentrales Thema, das mit verschiedenen Bereichen wie Bildung, Gesundheit und Wohnungsmarkt verbunden ist. Handeln ist entscheidend, um den Zulauf zur AfD zu begrenzen, wie beispielsweise durch die Einf√ºhrung der Bezahlkarte und Grenzkontrollen. Passives Reden reicht nicht aus, denn Handlungsbedarf besteht, insbesondere in F√§llen wie der geschilderten Radikalisierung einer Person.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Wahlen sind ja auch immer die Chance zur Repriorisierung der eigenen Agenda. Wir erkennen ganz klar, Klima ist nach hinten gerutscht, Migration ist nach vorne gerutscht, aber eben auch das Thema Frieden. Findet da auch in der Union, w√ºrden Sie sagen, jenseits des Grundsatzprogramms noch mal eine Repriorisierung Blick auf den Osten und mit Blick auf die drei Landtagswahlen statt?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Also ich glaube es ist offenkundig, das sagt die Demoskopie nat√ºrlich schon seit Monaten, dass das Thema Migration, das ist ein gro√üer wei√üer Elefant, weil das einfach mit allem zusammenh√§ngt, Mit dem Bildungssystem, mit dem Gesundheitssystem, mit dem Wohnungsmarkt und so weiter. Das Problem ist einfach, wenn etwas passiert, wie jetzt in ein Wahnheim, dann k√∂nnen wir noch so viel reden. Wenn wir nicht handeln, dann zahlt das bei der AfD ein. Und das ist das Problem beim Thema Migration. Wir m√ºssen handeln. Wir m√ºssen die Bezahlkarte einf√ºhren, was wir gemacht haben, die Grenzkontrollen zwischen Tschechien und Deutschland. Aber jetzt zum Beispiel diese Person, die Flucht gesucht hat in Deutschland, ich sag mal, um hier zu morden, ja, die hat sich nicht sondern radikalisiert.</blockquote>

2. Scaling Skills vs. Intelligence: Simply adding more knowledge and patterns through memorization improves performance but doesn't increase overall intelligence; skills enhance system capabilities without boosting intelligence.

### [06:21] Evolutionary Fit and General Intelligence


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (05:04 - 06:23)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/810f8024-067e-4452-8634-ff3aef8d72db)




### ‚ú® Summary
Creatures like insects have hard-coded behavioral programs in their genes that allow them to navigate their environment without needing to learn. If the environment was static, evolution would have created a perfect behavioral program hardcoded into genes. However, humans have general intelligence, being born with little knowledge but the ability to learn efficiently and adapt to new situations. This unique feature is challenging to replicate in machines.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In fact, many creatures, many insects, for instance, do not have intelligence. Instead, what they have is they have in their connectome, in their genes, heart -coded programs, behavioral programs that map some stimuli to a proper response. They can actually navigate their lives, their environment in a way that's very evolutionary fits that way without needing to learn anything. And while if our environment was static enough, predictable enough, what would have happened is that evolution would have found the perfect behavioral program, a hard coded static Behavioral program would have written it into our genes. We would have hard -coded brain connectome and that's what we will be running on. But no, that's not what happened. Instead, we have general intelligence. So we are born with extremely little knowledge about the world, but we are born with the ability to learn very efficiently and to adapt in the face of things that we've never seen before. And that's what makes us unique. And that's what is really, really challenging to recreate in machines.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I want to wrap it all in that a little bit. But before I do that, maybe I'm going to overlay some examples of what an Arc -like challenge looks like for the YouTube audience. But maybe for people listening on audio, can you just describe what would a sample Arc challenge looks like?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Scaling up a system by adding more knowledge and patterns through memorization improves its performance and usefulness but does not increase its intelligence. Skill and intelligence are distinct concepts, with adding skills enhancing the system's capabilities rather than its overall intelligence.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And they've got this sort of bank of solution programs. And when you give them a new puzzle, they can just fetch the appropriate program, apply it, and it's looking like it's reasoning. But really, it's not doing any sort of on -the -flight program synthesis. All it's doing is program fetching. So you can actually solve all these benchmarks with memorization. And so what you're scaling up here, like if you look at the models, they are big parametric curves fitted to the distribution, which I call in descent. So they're basically these big interpolative databases, interpolative memories. And of course, if you scale up the size of your database and you cram into it more knowledge, more patterns and so on, you are going to be increasing its performance as measured by memorization Benchmark. That's kind of obvious. But as you're doing it, you are not increasing the intelligence of the system one bit. You increasing the skill of the system. You're increasing its usefulness, its scope of applicability, but not its intelligence, because skill is not intelligence. And that's the fundamental confusion that people run into is that they're confusing skill and intelligence.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, there's a lot of fascinating things to talk about here. So skill, intelligence, interpolation.</blockquote>

### [01:10:58] Anxiety as a Survival Mechanism

### ‚ú® Summary
Anxiety is a survival mechanism that helps individuals prepare for potential dangers by causing worry and prompting preparation. The things that cause the most anxiety are often the least likely to harm, as being anxious leads to taking action to prevent negative outcomes. Maturing involves a shift from being anxious about everything to being more relaxed and unconcerned.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So look What you're but what you're talking about is so boring compared to what you think but what you're talking about is a is a distinct phenomena and that is Anxiety a lot of us but the First 40 years of my life. I didn't have enough anxiety. I was literally sleepwalking through life. I almost got kicked out of UCLA three times, didn't care, almost got fired from Oregon Stanley, didn't care. I just didn't, you know, took to Sunset Boulevard, fucked up in high school, didn't care. And then from 40 to 50, I had the perfect amount of anxiety. And now from 50 on, I fucking worry about everything. And anxiety, anxiety is a survival mechanism. Because you are supposed to be worried that when you see the reeds flowing in the wind, that it's not the wind, it's a line that could eat you behind. Because occasionally it is a line, and that you go to a watering hole. You are supposed to be anxious because it might be one of those TikTok crocodiles about to jump out. But here's the thing, anxiety is a form of survival, because the shit you are most worried about, if you're worried about every computer and every elevator and every air traffic control System, guidance system shutting down at midnight on January 1st, 2000, you start to prepare for it. Preparing for it and being anxious about it, you reduce the likelihood it's going to happen. And this is a lesson. The things you are most anxious about are the things that are least likely to hurt or kill you. It's the shit you're not expecting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I am exactly opposite to you. I used to be a lot more anxious and now I'm like, eh, whatever. Who cares? I literally have shifted. That means you're maturing.</blockquote>

1. When hiring executives, especially CEOs, focus on their strengths rather than just avoiding weaknesses. Look for candidates with extraordinary qualities instead of simply lacking issues.
2. AI is being used in healthcare as a nurse augmentation tool to handle repetitive tasks like medication reminders and data gathering. It complements the existing nurse workforce rather than replacing it.
3. Embracing new technologies like automation, AI, and robotics can revitalize American manufacturing. By integrating engineering on-site and focusing on building products in the US, companies can transition to true manufacturing entities and lead in the industry.

### [10:13] Focus on Strengths, not Weaknesses in Leadership Hiring


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (08:45 - 10:18)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c399b59-c0c5-4c1b-afe0-9ea8eba445e6)




### ‚ú® Summary
When it comes to hiring executives, especially CEOs, it's crucial to focus on what makes a candidate truly great rather than just looking for lack of weaknesses. A company should invest in those that have something extraordinary to offer rather than simply having nothing wrong with them. Committee decision-making often falls into the trap of avoiding weaknesses rather than recognizing and leveraging exceptional strengths. Consensus hiring tends to lead to the selection of candidates with a lack of weaknesses instead of those who excel in critical areas. It's essential to have a single decision-maker who can identify and evaluate a candidate's world-class qualities, and develop a plan to address any areas where they may not be exceptional.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>They're not really great at what you need them to be great at, etc, etc, etc. And this is, you know, we, I find this so often, and it's not just in CEOs, it's really in every executive position, but we do it a lot like in our business. We look at companies this way. You know, if a company has nothing wrong with it, you know, that's not a reason to invest. It has to have something truly great about it. And I think that the fact that, and I think, you know, part of it is a board isn't, you know, any competent person with who's kind of has experience in hiring would think about it this way. But I think when you get into a committee, the problem of committees always is this gets to another important point about hiring is that they always go for lack of weakness. Because it's easiest thing to say, Oh, I want to talk. I know what I can say. I can see this thing that's wrong with that guy, right? Like, but it's much harder to be so expert that you say this person is better than anybody in the world at this. And this is the thing that we actually need, which is also why I think that for CEOs, you can't do consensus hiring, because you end up with lack of weakness. That is the output. Like at the end of the day, you can take input, but there's got to be a single decision maker who knows what the person has to be world-class him and knows how to assess that, and then has And can build the plan to mitigate complement, deal with the things that the person isn't world-class.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
AI is being utilized in the healthcare industry as a nurse augmentation tool due to the significant shortage of nurses. While AI cannot fully replace nurses as it lacks the ability to perform physical tasks, it can handle important but repetitive tasks such as medication reminders and data gathering. Companies like Hippocratic AI are pricing AI services to be similar to those of a nurse, aiming to complement the existing nurse workforce rather than supplanting it.

And it's not, you know, you may think, Oh, my God, an AI is going to replace a nurse. Well, you know, like obviously an AI can't really at this stage replace a nurse fully, you know, nurses do a lot of things like, you know, wash you and stuff. There's no AI that can do that. But there is a massive nursing shortage. And there's a lot of nursing work that, you know, nurses don't necessarily want to do like ask you, or, you know, what medications are you on? You know, like when were you born? Or like call you later and say, did you take your medicine? These are important tasks, but things that can easily be done by an AI and Hippocratic Scott and AI that can kind of augment and, you know, your nurse workforce, which is, and as I said, They have a huge shortage of nurses right now.</blockquote>

Or by the way, did not, you know, earlier conversation of Boeing to not have American quote unquote manufacturing companies actually just be supply chain integration companies that They may actually need to get good at building, you know, the world's leading airline company in 10 years used to be good at building planes. And by the way, maybe that's a new company, but maybe those planes are made in the US in this new method. And they're made in a way that is better from a cost standpoint and from a quality standpoint and from a, you know, speed of improvement standpoint and, you know, having integrated engineering, You know, so you have engineers on site at the company at the factory constantly making everything better, you know, as opposed to just having the, you know, the factory off in some remote Location that your engineers never go. And so like, I think there's a path here, you know, that's, you know, you might almost call this like, you know, sort of like an operation warp speed for manufacturing, where you just Basically lean hard into this and you say, look, we're going to be re America will once again be the number one manufacturing company in the world, but not not because we are opposed to Automation or robotics or AI, but precisely because we're going to embrace all of this new technology as hard as we possibly can.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, and I think that's right.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. California has initiated sweeping actions to address homelessness following a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to crack down on encampments.
2. The state's homelessness crisis is linked to extreme income inequality and a lack of affordable housing, complicating solutions.
3. California lacks right to shelter laws, which presents challenges for mental health treatment and contributes to visible homelessness.
4. The temperate climate in California enables outdoor living, making it harder to manage the issue effectively.
5. Local governments are facing a shortage of shelter beds, hindering efforts to provide adequate housing for the homeless population.
6. Historically, officials have treated homelessness as a manageable issue rather than a solvable one, due to the high costs associated with potential solutions.

### ‚ú® Summary
Homelessness in California stems from extreme income inequality, a severe lack of affordable housing, and no right to shelter laws, which create challenges for mental health treatment and increase the visibility of homelessness. The state's temperate climate allows for outdoor living, while local governments face a shortage of shelter beds. Historically, officials have viewed homelessness as a manageable issue rather than one that can be resolved, largely due to the high costs associated with potential solutions.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>City after city facing these issues, they're all run by Democrats.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>OK, so in many ways, this place is really the face of Democrats in control, and the homelessness problem is right at the center of that. So let's dig into that problem. Why has homelessness become such a big issue in California?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, it's an extraordinarily complicated issue. It defies simple explanations, but basically it really all begins in California with extreme income inequality and a severe lack of affordable housing. California is one of the most expensive housing markets really in the country. On top of that, there are no right to shelter laws in California like there are in the East Coast. It's very difficult to force people into treatment if they're mentally ill and on the street because of commitment laws in the state. And the weather is temperate, so you can sleep outside. Local governments have a shortage of shelter beds. So a lot of reasons. For a long time, government officials in California, just generally, have seen homelessness less as a problem that can be solved exactly than as a problem to be managed. Because solving it was going to be very, very expensive.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Freedom of speech is protected, but there are limits. Genuine discriminatory harassment, intimidation (true threats that make a reasonable person fear bodily harm), defamation (falsely accusing someone of a crime), use of words for extortion or in furtherance of existing crimes are not protected. Expressing a viewpoint is a clearly protected form of speech. The bedrock principle in the United States upholds freedom of speech, as established in the Texas v. Johnson case of 1989 regarding the constitutionality of anti-flag burning laws.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And by the way, we actually have seen genuine discriminatory harassment on campus since October 7th in a number of cases. So it's not an unmeetable standard. Intimidation, also known as true threats, which is when you make someone... We'd make a reasonable person fear that they're in danger of bodily harm or death. That is not protected, nor should it be. Defamation is not protected, which is basically making a factual allegation that someone, for example, is guilty of an odious crime. I always gave the example I was at the student newspaper of, you know, groundlessly asserting that you know that someone is a pedophile, for example, is a classic example. Because that could ruin someone's life if they believed you. So, nobody really believes that there's no way to use words in a way that isn't protected. I mean, there's also, of course, you know, you use words to commit extortion, you use words to, that are incidental parts of existing crimes, you use words to commit conspiracies, for Example. But I think that the most clearly protected kind of freedom of speech is when you're merely expressing a viewpoint. And under that, they're really, the law, I think, sensibly set up in the United States to have what we call the bedrock principle, which is... It comes from a case called Texas v. Johnson from 1989, which is about whether or not you can burn an American flag or whether or not a anti -flag burning law would be constitutional.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The best approach for discussions in society is to have a system where people can freely express their opinions, even if they are disagreeable or potentially dangerous if acted upon. The focus should be on allowing all ideas to collide in the public sphere without government coercion, so that the best idea can prevail over others. This concept aligns with the marketplace of ideas theory of freedom of speech, which promotes open discourse and the winning of the best idea through this collision of diverse opinions.

### [15:18] Japan's Debt Crisis and Economic Challenges


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (11:52 - 15:15)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8b587036-c1d6-4015-89ba-f0211c6ef09e)




### ‚ú® Summary
Japan's public debt has reached an alarming 263% of GDP, totaling 1.3 quadrillion yen against an annual GDP of 591 trillion yen. Current government spending is about 20% of GDP, with 5% dedicated to servicing debt at near-zero interest rates. If interest rates rise, the government would struggle to manage its debt obligations. The Bank of Japan holds 53% of government bonds, amounting to 100% of GDP, reflecting an unsustainable reliance on central bank support. Contributing factors include a series of crises since the early 90s, leading to an escalation in public debt to support recovery efforts, alongside a rapidly aging population. Today, 33% of government spending is allocated to Social Security, compared to 20% in the US. The aging demographic pressures the government to sustain social programs while managing debt, with the looming issue of keeping interest rates low to avoid increased inflation. The inability to adjust interest rates effectively puts Japan in a precarious situation, facing potential economic contraction, extensive taxation, or inflation as a consequence of its significant debt burden.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>To GDP ratio is currently 263%. They have about 1.3 quadrillion yen of public debt on an annual GDP of about 591 trillion yen. They're currently at the federal level spending about 20% of GDP per year. 5% of GDP is being spent per year just on servicing the existing debt. And that's at interest rates set by the central bank of roughly 0%. So, you know, or whatever the market is trading it at, so slightly above 0%. But if the central bank had to start to raise rates, because inflation started to run away because there's so much, again, in circulation, there's so much debt outstanding. The federal government would not be able to actually service this debt. So as of March of 2024, the Bank of Japan, the central bank, actually holds 53% of Japan's outstanding government bonds, which is equal to about 100% of Japan's GDP. So their central bank has bought the debt that's being issued by the federal government to fund their budget, a large chunk of which right now is being spent just on paying the interest On the debt, while interest rates are close to 0%. So imagine if interest rates bumped up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5%, as we're seeing with US Treasuries, we were recently at a nearly 5 handle on the 10-year Treasury, it would become an unsustainable Debt burden for the Japanese government to be able to handle that. And a large part of this is being driven by a number of crises that Japan has faced since the early 90s. So there was the financial crisis in a way, there was the nuclear meltdown, there was a couple of earthquakes, tsunamis, and a lot of debt has been taken on to support the country after Those crises. But really importantly, and Nick, if you could just pull up this age chart, is the aging of the Japanese population. So this chart shows that, and you can kind of see back to 1950, when the average age in Japan was 21 years old. And today, the average age in Japan is around 48. You know, in the next decade, it'll be 50, then it'll be 52. So that means more and more people are relying on public pension. Today, 33% of their government spending goes towards their Social Security programs. In the US, for comparison, Social Security is about 20% of federal spending. So that number is only getting bigger and bigger. As the population ages, the Japanese government has to continue to service their older population, and they've had to face several crises. Their debt has ballooned to a level that is well beyond any other industrialized nation. And the only way to continue to service that debt economically is to keep interest rates low. And the problem with keeping interest rate low? Inflation. And that's the big driver that caused them to say, let's uptake the interest by 15 bips or 25 bips is to try and tackle the inflation problem they're facing, just like our central bank Recently tried to do the same. But clearly the market can't have it. So Japan isn't a real pickle. And I think that it shows how much having a large amount of federal debt can impact the ability for a nation to maneuver itself during difficult times. And ultimately, debt payments come due, they come to you either in the form of economic contraction, or massive taxes or inflation. And currently, Japan is paying for it in terms of inflation.</blockquote>

### [05:24] Statistical Outliers and Individual Agency


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (04:36 - 05:26)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42439d32-1521-4e2a-810d-37f1f34050ed)




### ‚ú® Summary
One's individuality transcends statistical generalizations. Each person is an outlier with a unique range of possibilities, not limited by averages or medians. Personal agency is ignited by recognizing this individuality amidst statistical categorizations. Statistics are merely observations, not definitive conclusions, as economic prosperity is not uniformly distributed.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Much of my professional life looking at data sets and making broad generalizations, many of which are not encouraging. However, you are one data point, not the set. You are not your cohort. You are not sentenced to be the average of your peers, the median of your race or the mean of your gender. Agency begins with this insight within the mass of humans lumped together by statisticians on several dimensions. You are an outlier. Your range of possible outcomes is invisible to the statistician's eye. Statistics are observations, not conclusions. The pie of economic prosperity is not sliced evenly.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Acknowledge that in good times, much of it isn't your doing and be grateful, but also lower your risk profile. Similarly, in tough times, remember that others have gone through the same and come out stronger. Be cautious after a big win, as you may become overconfident. Embrace the impermanence of life, be grateful, and accept that experiencing highs and lows is part of the journey.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But when things go poorly and you are hurt, really hurt, heartbroken, laid off, make poor investments, lose someone you love. Realize there are millions of people who've experienced the exact same thing and gone on to live wonderful lives. On the flip side, realize that when you get promoted, register professional success or find yourself in a good relationship, you should acknowledge again much of this isn't your fault And you should be grateful and lower your risk profile. You are never more susceptible to a big mistake than after a big win. As you fall under the delusion that it's all you versus good fortune. Finite. Wow, life has gone so slowly said nobody ever. My superpower is atheism. No kidding. I believe at some point I will look into my son's eyes and know our relationship is coming to an end. And that's okay.

### ‚ú® Summary
The UK's decision to leave the European Union without a backup plan led to a loss of financial clout. London has lost significant financial flows to the EU and the US, causing the UK to essentially isolate itself economically. Attempts to become an unethical hub for Russian money were impacted by the Ukraine war, and Dubai has surpassed London in Arabic financing. The UK's financial hub status has significantly diminished post-Brexit, with the country losing its role as an industrial and financial hub.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Until a few years ago when the Brits voted themselves out of the European Union without a backup plan. For the last few years, under the conservative governments of Theresa May and Boris Johnson and on and on and on, they've had like what, seven? Geez. Anyway, the Brits have basically been trying to have their cake and eat it too after voting that cake is illegal. That's basically what it comes down to. They've shut themselves off from the European system and induced the Europeans to grab as much of the financial clout that London used to have as possible. The Americans, of course, have taken more than their fair share as well. And that just leaves the United Kingdom with what's generated by the United Kingdom, and then a few stray wisps here and there. They made a go at being the completely unethical hub, particularly for Russian money, but in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, a lot of that has lost its luster. And if you want to do Arabic financing, you're not going to come to London, you're going to go to Dubai. All of the financial flows that made London an industrial and a financial hub are pretty much gone. And the last big chunk is gone because the Brits voted themselves out of the system. So what we have now is not so much a shift from the right to the left. If you guys haven't seen the election results, they're pretty damning.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Developing AI systems carries inherent risks that require comprehensive management to prevent authoritarian regimes from leveraging AI against democratic societies. A coordinated effort is necessary at both local and federal levels to ensure AI is safe and beneficial, particularly in countering rogue AI developments in other nations. It is crucial to acknowledge that countries like China may seek to appropriating technology from the U.S., and enhancing the safety of AI models can provide a competitive advantage. Authoritarian governments inherently resist decentralized power, making it vital to continue responsible AI practices. The dynamic between responsible action in AI development and the potential actions of countries like China is complex and cannot be easily predicted; the assumption that responsible behavior will lead to irresponsible actions from rivals isn't guaranteed.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So I think we have to deal with both problems. We have to deal with the risks that are caused by the systems that we're creating. And we have to make sure that we don't end up in a situation where some authoritarian government elsewhere uses AI, develops AI, that is turned against democracies. So it isn't like one or the other. We have to deal with both. And 1047 is more addressing the local But I think the federal government has a responsibility with the companies to make sure that we are on a path where we can create AI that's going to Be safe and that we can use that AI, for example, to protect ourselves against potentially rogue AI coming up in other countries.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And if I can just add in there, it seems that one of China's main strategies around AI and technology is to steal it from US companies. And so, you know, that's important to keep in mind. And if we've improved the safety of these models, that'll be beneficial. I also think in terms of authoritarian governments, China, Russia, whatever, they're not going to want to have separate sources of power in terms of increasingly powerful AI that Could undermine their own control. And so that's sort of just an inherent aspect of any authoritarian government. So I don't think it's as clear as some have stated that, oh, if we act responsibly, if we act responsibly around AI, then China is just going to act irresponsibly and eclipse us. It's unclear to me that that is actually the case.</blockquote>

Along the way they‚Äôd discovered a wondrous opportunity (machine learning powered social media feed recommendations). They forged incredible Power in the CUDA platform, and used it to triumph over seemingly insurmountable adversity ‚Äî the stock market penalty-box.<br/>>  But, it turned out that was only the precursor to an even wilder journey. Over the past 18 months Nvidia has weathered one of the steepest stock crashes in history ($500B+ market cap wiped away peak-to-trough!). And, it has of course also experienced an even more fantastical rise ‚Äî becoming the platform that‚Äôs powering the emergence of perhaps a new form of intelligence itself‚Ä¶ and in the process becoming a trillion-dollar company.<br/>>  Today we tell another chapter in the amazing Nvidia saga: the dawn of the AI era.

### [01:00:53] Challenges of Memory Scaling in AI Model Training


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (59:15 - 01:00:51)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7cc57b06-5f76-4926-a0a4-af57820c50ab)




### ‚ú® Summary
High-performance memory constraints in AI model training are challenging, as models require hundreds of gigabytes of memory, while the available on-chip RAM is limited. Memory scaling has not kept pace with the increasing size of AI models, leading to the need to network multiple chips and servers together for efficient training. The inability to increase memory chip size due to technological constraints necessitates close proximity of large memory amounts to processors for fast data transfer. This requirement highlights the importance of optimizing memory and data processing for effective model training.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, there's this amazing video that we'll link to on the Asianometry YouTube channel that we link to also on the TSMC episode. But the constraint today is actually in how much high performance memory is available on the chip. These models need to be in memory all at the same time and they take up hundreds of gigabytes. So while memory has scaled up, I mean, we're going to get flashing all the way forward, the H100's on-chip RAM is like 80 gigabytes. The memory hasn't scaled up nearly as fast as the models have actually scaled in size. The memory requirements for training AI are just obscene. So it becomes imperative to network multiple chips and multiple servers of chips and multiple racks of servers of chips together into one single computer, and I'm putting computer And air quotes there, in order to actually train these models. It's also worth noting, we can't make the memory chips any bigger. Due to a quirk of the extreme ultraviolet photolithography that we talked about, the EUV on the TSMC episode, chips are already the full size of the reticle. It's a physics and wavelength constraint. You really can't etch chips larger without some new invention that we don't have commercially viable yet. So what it ends up meaning is you need huge amounts of memory, very close to the processors, all running in parallel with the fastest possible data transfer. And again, this is a vast oversimplification, but you kind of get the idea of why all of this becomes so important.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Okay, so back to the data center.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The Supreme Court ruling aims to protect all presidents, including potential future situations where a former president may face prosecution by their political rivals. The ruling prevents the prosecution of former presidents by their successors for acts in office, maintaining the American legal tradition. However, it may embolden future presidents to push the boundaries of presidential power, knowing that criminal prosecution after leaving office is unlikely. This ruling has been met with contrasting reactions from President Biden and former President Trump, with Trump praising it as a victory for the Constitution and democracy, while Biden's campaign criticized it as giving Trump dictatorial powers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think that's right. And it's also the case that the court authentically wants to protect every president, including Joe Biden. Assume a world in which Biden loses, Trump wins, and Trump follows through on thinly veiled threats to exact retribution from his political rivals and tries to prosecute Biden. This ruling would very much protect Biden. And Chief Justice Roberts writes that presidents many controversial and unpopular acts that are not hard to characterize as criminal. Do you want the next president to be prosecuting the former one that's never been part of the American legal tradition? So this is good, I suppose, for outgoing presidents who will not be prosecuted by their political rivals over what they did in office. But it does a second thing. It emboldens the next president and the president after that to test the boundaries of presidential power because they'll know that the Supreme Court has said, there is almost nothing They can do in an arguably official way, that will ever cause them to be prosecuted criminally after they leave office.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, Adam, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you, Michael. On Monday afternoon, both President Biden and former President Trump issued statements reacting to the court's ruling. Trump celebrated the decision, calling it, quote, a big win for our Constitution and democracy. The Biden campaign denounced it, saying that the court had, quote, handed Donald Trump the keys to a dictatorship.</blockquote>

### [15:57] Seeking Purpose in a World of Superintelligence


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (14:37 - 15:56)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/598e7564-4a60-4e4b-86d0-aac35758e7a6)




### ‚ú® Summary
In a world where superintelligence exists, individuals may struggle to find meaningful contributions as systems become more creative and take over all jobs. The concept of Iki Gai, finding something one is good at, enjoys, and is valued by society, is crucial to maintaining a sense of purpose and happiness amidst the advancements in technology and intelligence.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think about a lot of things. Well, there is X risk, existential risk, everyone's dead. There is S risk, suffering risks, where everyone wishes they were dead. We have also idea for I risk, Iki Gai risks, where we lost our meaning. The systems can be more creative, they can do all the jobs. It's not obvious what you have to contribute to a world where superintelligence exists. Of course, you can have all the variants you mentioned where we are safe, we are kept alive, but we are not in control, we are not deciding anything, we are like animals in a zoo. There is again, possibilities we can come up with is very smart humans and then possibilities something a thousand times smarter can come up with four reasons we cannot comprehend.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would love to sort of dig into each of those X risk, S risk and I risk. So can you like linger on I risk? What is that?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You, Japanese concept of Iki Gai, you find something which allows you to make money, you are good at it and the society says we need it. So like you have this awesome job, you are a podcaster, gives you a lot of meaning, you have a good life, I assume you're happy. That's what we want most people to find to have.</blockquote>

### [39:39] Emergent Intelligence in AI Development


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (38:03 - 39:41)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/704e2ac9-3f87-4caf-8d57-ba112f566533)




### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker highlights the misconception that intelligence in AI is not a product of human design but rather an emergent phenomenon. Unlike older expert systems, modern AI models are trained with data and compute resources, leading to emergent intelligence. This emergent intelligence allows for capabilities beyond what is hard-coded, requiring testing over several years to understand fully. The speaker emphasizes the limitless potential of emergent intelligence in AI development, contrasting it with the controlled ceiling under human-designed code.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I cannot make a case that he's right. He's wrong in so many ways. It's difficult for me to remember all of them. He's a Facebook buddy, so I have a lot of fun having those little debates with him. So I'm trying to remember the arguments. So one, he says we are not gifted this intelligence from aliens. We are designing it. We are making decisions about it. That's not true. It was true when we had expert systems, symbolic AI, decision trees. Today you set up parameters for a model and you water this plant. You give it data, you give it compute and it grows. And after it's finished growing into this alien plant, you start testing it to find out what capabilities it has. And it takes years to figure out even for existing models. If it's trained for six months, it will take you two, three years to figure out basic capabilities of that system. We still discover new capabilities in systems which are already out there. So that's not the case.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So just the link on that, did you the difference there? There is some level of emergent intelligence that happens in our current approaches. So stuff that we don't hard code in.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Absolutely. That's what makes it so successful. And we had to painstakingly hard code in everything. We didn't have much progress now. Just spend more money and more compute and it's a lot more capable.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And then the question is, when there is emergent intelligent phenomena, what is the ceiling of that? For you, there's no ceiling. For free on the code, I think there's a kind of ceiling that happens that we have full control over.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Startups focusing on virtual customer support agents have made significant progress in enhancing agent conversational abilities and responsiveness. However, the pace of innovation in this field renders previous product roadmaps obsolete. There is still room for improvement in integrating AI with customer support tools and customizing models for specific verticals. The rapid evolution in this technology means that developers must understand where model innovation ends and their unique contributions begin to avoid creating solutions that quickly become outdated.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>That was good. Just one point on that is there are a whole bunch of startups out there that work creating virtual customer support agents. And they've been spending the last couple of years working on trying to make those agents more conversational, quicker, more responsive. I think their product roadmaps has became obsolete. Now, that's not to say there isn't more work for them to do in workflow in terms of integrating the AI with customer support tools and doing that last mile of customizing the model for The vertical specific problems of customer support. But my guess is that hundreds of millions of dollars of R&D just went out the window. And probably this is the best time to be creating a customer support agent company.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>If you're doing it two years ago, five years ago, your work has just like been. Well, I mean, that is the thing of this pace. Like, you know, you used to have to throw away client server stuff or, you know, whatever. You had a web based thing. You get an app out. You throw away some of the old code.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>But this is like every 18 months your work has been replaced. If you're an app developer, the key thing to understand is where does model innovation end and your innovation begin? Because if you get wrong, you'll end up doing a bunch of stuff that the model will just obsolete in a few months.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So that Google can do answers like this. The workflow stuff in Gmail also kicked ass the demo that they showed was you get a bunch of receipts and the person giving the demo, she said something the effective. Well, wouldn't it be great if like, you know, the AI assistant were able to find all the receipts and then aggregated them and put them in a folder and then also actually generated an expense Report or like a spreadsheet on the fly? It's crazy. I got to say, I think that it's free to change your mind. And so it's good to do that. Oh, and I think that Chamath in a rare moment of reflection might do a, are we going to have a re underwriting? Is this a re underwriting? I change my mind all the time. I just, I mean, you know, because I'm a gentleman breaking news.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I think the Google thing is pretty special between last week's announcement of isomorphic</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Value creation in startups is viewed as a shared journey, benefiting not just customers but also employees who contribute to the success.
2. Startups enable employees to share in the financial rewards generated by collective efforts, contrasting with traditional employment's salary limitations.
3. This model fosters a culture of innovation and risk-taking, emphasizing the ethical responsibility of founders and their teams to capture only the value they actively create.
4. Acknowledging the risks and potential gains positions startups as a space for meaningful financial engagement that is advantageous for all stakeholders.

### ‚ú® Summary
Understanding startups as platforms for shared success highlights a profound insight: when creating something that people need, the benefits can extend beyond customers to the employees who contribute to that success. Unlike traditional employment, where wealth is limited to salaries, startups allow employees to share in the financial rewards generated by their collective efforts. This model promotes innovation and risk-taking, reinforcing an ethical dimension where founders and their teams only capture the value they actively create. By acknowledging the risks and potential for substantial gains, we see startups as a space for meaningful financial engagement that benefits everyone involved.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I mean, it seems now that you say it, it seems so obvious, but it's really not like just a pause on the idea when you're doing a startup, you're building something that other people want And need. That's a really profound idea. On that note, it's also very fascinating because of the economics of startups, because usually if you're working for a company, you were talking about you and Alice being at McKinsey Consulting, people think they're making good money, you know, but you're really captive to your salary. You're not actually the wealth is not generative. And one thing that I find really powerful about startups is that startups are the ones that innovated on the idea that employees can have a share of the returns on the work they do. So even though you might be building a product for customers and consumers that people want, if you succeed, you know, it can also be go to nothing, obviously, that's the very real risk. But if you succeed, there can be very real gains for the people who put things in, especially for those that took a risk early on. I don't know how the options and the economics work in UK startups, but that is I think a defining feature of Silicon Valley in the early days. And so I just wanted to point that out because it's actually resonant to what you said about not only pleasing people and being captive, but you're also helping other people and then Actually creating value that for the employees too, they're always increasing the size of the pie for everyone in some form. So I mean, not to be cliche, but that's very true.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In a way, I think there's a really important sort of ethical point here, which is that founders, yeah, they can make a lot of money, but they only get to capture value that they create. That's right. I think that that is actually a really important idea. And I find, again, we focus mainly on people early in their career when we're working with founders.</blockquote>

The speaker reflects on how the world has changed since the 60s and 70s, questioning if young people can easily buy houses or find stable jobs. They support Bernie Sanders' ideas, expressing concern that the American dream of working 40 hours a week for a dignified life is fading away. The speaker acknowledges the complexity of the world and suggests that these societal shifts are influencing our current experiences.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And I can just see that the world that I grew up in in the 60s and 70s is just different on the most basic level. Can a young person like my dad did at 21, 22 buy a house? Hmm. Are there a lot of jobs out there where you can show up for 40 hours a week and have all your needs met and your dignity preserved? Hmm. So I think Bernie Sanders is on the right track about a lot of this stuff and the idea that we have had a slow drift into a drift away from what I would consider kind of the American dream, Which is, let me go to work 40 hours a week and in exchange, you give me a life full of dignity. I think we're not there anymore. So I think if you take those two things together, that explains a lot of what we're experiencing. Again, who knows? I mean, the world is vast and my mind is small.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>How do you think about celebrity and our relationship to fame?</blockquote>

### [14:32] Implications of Inflation and Interest Rates


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (13:08 - 14:33)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61376711-f2f0-4c15-8f87-65dd8917cc0c)




### ‚ú® Summary
Managing inflation down to 2% can lead to a lower interest rate, stimulating investment. Higher interest rates, on the other hand, create a drag on the economy. Even small changes in inflation rates can impact the market; however, crossing from a 3% to a 2% inflation rate can have significant psychological effects on people's perception of the economy.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So in other words, let's say the Fed wanted to target a 2% real return, that means that the interest rate would be 5% with the 3% rate of inflation. Whereas, if inflation can be managed down to 2%, you would have 4% interest rate. And that persistently, if we're talking permanently, higher interest rate will create a drag on the economy. Because lower interest rates create more investment. They reduce the hurdle rates to take risk, whereas higher interest rates, as we've seen, create drag on equities and drag on investment. So if they redefine the inflation rate to three and set it to two, there will be long -term consequences from that. That is not a free thing to do. So that would be like one part of the answer. The other thing is just, yeah, look, inflation going from 3 .1 to 3 .0 is positive. It's good news. Better than it going from 3 .1 to 3 .2, but we're talking about 0 .1%. And I just think people get a little too excited reading into these prints, when these are not huge changes in numbers. I do think that once the inflation rate starts with a two handle, that psychologically I think will be a big change for people.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Psychology has so much to do with this, I thought I was doing a little research on it, why it's so contentious, and there's so much of a lack of consensus about it. Nick, pull up this chart. I wanted to share it with you guys.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The closest villages and settlements to the Russia-Ukraine border are enduring attacks from Russia without being allowed to hit back, creating a significant disadvantage. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is under constant Russian bombardment, forcing Ukraine to divert soldiers to defend the city. Despite intelligence about Russian troop buildup and preparation across the border, Ukraine is restricted from striking due to limitations on using Western weaponry, leaving them no choice but to watch the preparations for an impending attack.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>They are in the closest villages and settlements to the border from Russia, knowing that we will not respond.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>He was conveying the sense of fighting with one hand tied behind his back and they have to endure the attacks from Russia, the bombings and the artillery strikes, and they're not allowed To hit back.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>That is there. Big advantage.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And then Kharkivski. He talked about the northeastern part of Ukraine near Ukraine's second largest city, Harkiv. It's been a target of Russian attack. It's bombarded almost daily. And it's now one of the focal points of the war. To defend Harkiv, Ukraine has been forced to divert soldiers from elsewhere to fight this Russian incursion with the city at their backs. Russia is piling up the troops. They are. And Zelensky was telling us that his intelligence can see the Russians unloading from trains, weaponry and equipment just across the border in Russia. But he's not allowed to strike it because of the restriction on the use of Western weaponry. And so he said he has no choice but to watch them prepare to attack. And he had a very vivid image for this.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Ukraine faces challenges in mobilizing soldiers, with reluctance from the population leading to the need for forced recruitment. Villages have experienced a significant call-up of men, leaving some without male residents. Women have protested draft officials to protect the remaining men. Roadblocks and surprise checkpoints have been set up in cities to check draft registration, causing disruption and fear among men. There are even social media apps used to track the movement of draft officials in order to avoid encounters. President Zelensky is facing the challenge of persuading men to enlist in the military amid these difficulties.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In Ukraine, there are three to four million men who could be drafted and could be serving in the military. So they could be fighting a war of attrition with Russia, with the larger army, were they able to mobilize and equip these additional soldiers. But they haven't done this and there's been quite a bit of reluctance. So they're at a moment now where they need soldiers, but the patriotic wave from earlier in the war has really washed over. And at this point, they're going to have to use the power of calling up men against their will in order to continue fighting this war.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What does that look like in Ukraine now?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, the call up of men from villages in some areas of Ukraine has been so great that there are villages without men. There are villages where women, when they see the draft, officials coming into town, they have swarmed these vehicles and are protesting to protect the few remaining men in these areas. There have been roadblocks put up in Kiev and other towns to stop cars and check draft registration documents on the street. And sometimes men are asked to report to basic training within as little of a week after being stopped at one of these surprise checkpoints. And this has been disruptive and men are fearful of being caught in one of these roadblocks and approached by draft officials. And there are even social media apps that track where they're moving around town, for example, in Kiev there's an app called Weather in Kiev and it'll say it's raining on a certain intersection. And that would mean that the draft officials are there and men should avoid that area.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Interesting. And is Zelensky acknowledging this challenge? I mean, the challenge of trying to get men to fight in the war?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The rise of LLMs creating their own content poses a challenge to traditional media companies. The monopolistic control over search engines by one dominant player has hindered innovation in the search space. This monopoly is seen as a threat that warrants government intervention to prevent monopolistic control and potential negative impacts on the media industry.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And I thought, they're not even going to need the original content. These LLMs are creating their own vogue and own travel and leisure and own economist content for the other LLMs to satisfy or sat there in satiable appetite.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But it is definitely, it feels like the traditional media companies are a little bit on the wrong side of it. Yeah. So how do people find things? Anyway, it's a really interesting time. And I got to tell you they're making, look, let me just make one more comment and move on to the next thing is said, because they're a monopoly and they are. There has been no innovation in search because they run it. No one else, they've tried all these different people. As you know, you invested in one of the attempts. There's all kinds of attempts to do it, but their duck duck go is very tiny. They've got the deal wrapped up with Apple essentially, but paying them an enormous amount of money. There's been no innovation in search. It really hasn't. This is that, but at their pace and to their advantage. So it's even worse that they're a monopoly now. The government really needs to step in here around this monopolistic position they have. In any case, it's really an interesting time and media companies have to, once again, guess what, they're coming for you.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In 2023, total new government spending in the U.S. surpassed the total increase in private spending for the first time outside of a recession, making the government the primary driver of economic growth. This shift, if continued, could lead to a less healthy economic position resembling countries like Zimbabwe, South Africa, or Venezuela. While there is still significant private investment and economic activity, a trend of increasing government influence could potentially impact long-term dynamism and the size of the American economy, which has been a key driver of growth over the past two centuries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The driver's seat, except in times of recession, which is when the government steps in. And if you add the two together, you get actually a pretty even line. What has changed in calendar year 2023 is that relationship broke. And for the first time in modern American history, total new government spending, not just the deficit, but the increase in the deficit year on year, that number surpassed the total Increase in private spending for the first time in American history outside of a recession. Now this is only one data point. I don't want to overplay this, but for the first time in American history the government has become the primary driver of economic growth in the country. This is not a healthy position to be in. This is a very Zimbabwe, South African, Venezuelan sort of approach to economic management. Now, there's still trillions of dollars of private investment. There's still tens of trillions of dollars of private economic activity. This is not something I'm overly stressy about right now. But if the numbers from last year are repeated this year, and based on the Biden administration spending, it looks like they will be. And then next year, which Biden has indicated they probably will be, or if Trump wins, it absolutely indicates plans to expand the government. Then we're in a different era of it. And if you remove the private sector as the primary driver of American economic growth, yes, you might get a little bit more pop support for the government, or a particular candidate, But it comes at the cost of long -term dynamism and size of the American economy, which has served the United States very well these last 200 years.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, historically different, are now primarily focused on being cloud service providers by building and renting out data centers. This signifies a significant shift in their business models. With operating incomes heavily reliant on cloud services, companies like Microsoft and Amazon are investing vast amounts of money to match government spending on infrastructure development, indicating a changing mission towards providing cloud services.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Scott, your thoughts? A lot here. So let's start with Microsoft. It's staggering. The Infrastructure Act at the US government, largest economic power in history, $1.2 trillion. Just the three or four companies we talk about invested $32 billion or an annual run rate of $120 billion. So the Infrastructure Act is supposed to take place. I think that's spending over probably the better part of a decade. So you could argue that these companies are kind of at least right now and granted it won't continue this way. But these companies are essentially spending almost on pace what the government is spending to try and reinvigorate and upgrade America. It's just staggering how much money these folks are spending on. And it was this long-winded way of saying, it'd be very interesting to try and figure out, are there companies that make generators that are especially good at cooling data centers Or specialized in construction or selling materials into the types of infrastructure they're going to be building? Because the amount of investment here, it's just staggering. What are your thoughts?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I just think it's fascinating how all of these big tech companies, which historically, we thought of as very different. Amazon is e-commerce, Google search, Microsoft is PCs. They're all basically turning into the same company now. And that is they're all cloud service providers. They all are building data centers and then they rent those data centers out to smaller internet companies. And the greatest evidence of that is just the operating income of these companies. So just as an example, 45% of Microsoft's business today, as measured by operating income, is cloud. And for Amazon, that number is 60%. It feels like once you reach this level of scale, like these companies have, it's almost like the mission changes.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The complexity of the tax system results in a transfer of wealth from earners to owners, with wealthy individuals benefiting from loopholes. Capitalism accepts winners and losers, rewarding hard work and talent. However, the system has shifted towards cronyism, favoring owners and becoming inequitable and unsustainable over time.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We can't say for sure what percent owners pay on average, but it's less than most of their employees pay. This complexity results in a transfer of wealth from earners to owners. The tax code has exploded from 400 to 4000 pages in the past few decades. If you have GPS, advisors, loopholes for the wealthy, you want races run at night. If the government is meant to decrease suffering and add happiness, then our current system makes no sense. Paying taxes of $5 million on $10 million in income is the difference between flying first class and flying private. Paying $15,000 on $60,000 in income might mean for going a second child. Capitalism means accepting a society of winners and losers. And that's okay. Wealth is a great reward for hard work, and talent is what drives us to create value. And capitalism has brought prosperity to billions over the past 150 years. The problem is the system, if left unchecked, becomes increasingly inequitable and unsustainable. We've morphed from capitalism to cronyism, rigged in favor of owners. How?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurs moving to tax-friendly states like Texas and Florida to avoid state income tax on their enormous stock gains exemplifies a trend in tax optimization. Elon Musk's move to Texas saved him $2.5 billion in California income tax, while Jeff Bezos relocated to Florida to save on taxes and sold 50 million shares of Amazon. The choice to benefit from infrastructure and resources in one state while not contributing to taxes can be seen as a disservice to the community and a disproportionate burden on middle-class taxpayers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Several years ago, the media discovered the phenomenon of California entrepreneurs moving to Texas and Florida, and there was a lot of jazz hands about those state's friendly business Climates and youthful energy. The truth was simpler. Texas and Florida have no state income tax, and many of those founders were about to recognize enormous gains via sales of stock that had become worth billions. Elon Musk, who moved to Texas in 2020, sold millions of shares of Tesla, saving an estimated $2.5 billion in California income tax. When Washington state enacted a tax on income from asset sales, Jeff Bezos decided to spend more time with his father in Florida, which has no income tax, and sold 50 million shares of Amazon after he relocated. If taking advantage of Washington's schools, roads, and tech ecosystem to build wealth, and then declining to pay taxes back to the state sounds wrong, and a massive additional burden On middle-class taxpayers who can't peace out to Coral Gables, trust your instincts.</blockquote>

### [15:31] Relevance, Differentiation, and Sustainability: The Key to Successful Innovation


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (14:14 - 15:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a960bfd-07a4-4aab-82da-6ac5484ce863)




### ‚ú® Summary
Innovation success hinges on three critical factors: relevance, differentiation, and sustainability. A product must be relevant to consumer needs, differentiated from competitors, and sustainable in the long term. Tesla's electric cars and Starlink's satellite technology exemplify this by offering clear differentiation, relevance to consumer needs, and sustainable business models. Starlink's technology, with its crystal-clear communication capabilities, exemplifies differentiation and relevance, coupled with SpaceX's dominant satellite presence showcasing sustainability. These factors ultimately determine the success and impact of technological innovations in the market.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Very few of us are in the market for a $550 ,000 electric car. Whereas Kleenex is highly relevant, we all need it, but it's hard to maintain that differentiation. So these two things are in combat with each other, but say you find something that is truly differentiated and is relevant. Well, Tesla seems to be differentiated and it's relevant. People are interested in EVs. Okay, the third hurdle, is it sustainable? Can we own it? So back to Starlink, it's differentiated. I mean, you get a call on a plane on FaceTime video, it's crystal clear. Is it relevant? Oh yeah. I mean, we're gonna try and do these pods next week. I need serious broadband, highly relevant. And then is it differentiated? And this is why I think this thing is gonna be the technology of the year. 60% of all currently orbiting satellites belong to SpaceX. Almost two thirds of all, that's just crazy. So even if someone says, this is an amazing business, we got to get into it, we're Boeing, whoever it is, we're Amazon, we have deep pockets, to figure out a way to get the Falcon X heavy Rocket or whatever it is, the launch capacity, to get these satellites into space, that is a moat the size of the Amazon. Anyways, this latest version, 599, this is a 10X better product at substantially lower price.</blockquote>

### [01:12:00] Stability in Economy Requires GDP Growth to Exceed Inflation Rate

### ‚ú® Summary
Stability in the economy depends on ensuring that the GDP growth rate surpasses the inflation rate. The current situation of slowing GDP growth, decreasing inflation, and increasing wages is the indication of stagflation. However, the rise in labor rates alone does not paint a positive scenario as the overall revenue (GDP) must outpace the increasing costs for stability. The existing instability highlights the difficulty and strain in the economic system, emphasizing the necessity for a return to a state where GDP growth outstrips inflation to achieve a normalized and steady economy.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is very hard on people. Chama, what's your take on this? We have a slowing GDP growth. We have inflation going from nine down to three. We have wages going up 4%. How do you make sense of all this? Do you feel like? Sorry, Freeburg, are you saying we're gonna have stagflation or we have stagflation right now?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Definitely. But I what I'm saying is that it's not a rosy picture just because labor rates are going up. If the labor rates aren't going up, and you can see this ultimately, the best number for this is the sum of GDP growth. So in aggregate, if the revenue of everything combined, which is GDP, isn't going up faster than the increase in the cost of everything, people, businesses, and the government can't Afford their stuff. And that's fundamentally what's going on right now. What we need to see is a normalization where GDP growth is greater than inflation rate. And as soon as that happens, then we have a more normalized and stable economy. So right now, things are not stable. There's a lot of difficulty and strain in the system.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And I'm not suggesting you go to that extreme, but try and be kind of first in, last out. Show that you come to play. Josh Brown from CNBC and from Ritz -Hold Wealth Management had a really good idea that I thought was very simple. I never thought about it. Find the shittiest part of your boss's job and take it off their plate and slowly but surely try and give them time back. If you can do anything, whether it's responding to RFPs, I don't know what job you're doing, but try and really understand, learn and do stuff and volunteer for stuff and do your best To try and take the worst part of other people's jobs off their plate such that you become indispensable to them. Because if you make their life easier, you're going to be indispensable. Try and praise, always praise people behind their backs. Be known as the guy that praises people behind their backs. Listen when you're in meetings, try and really understand what's going on. Be very social, ask people out to coffees, ask them a bunch of questions. You don't need to be explicit about finding mentors. I've never said to anyone, will you be my mentor? But I am blessed with a ton of mentors because I would ask them out for coffee. I'd ask them a lot of questions. When you're older and you've got some experience under your belt, you like it when people ask you questions. It's the reason I have this damn podcast is I like giving advice. You feel like you have value to add. You want to share it with young men and young women. So don't be afraid to ask people out for coffee and ask for their advice, ask for their feedback. And generally speaking, I think success is in the last 10%. What do I mean by that? We used to write RFPs in my first album, Morgan Stanley. And Morgan Stanley had this kind cultural zeitgeist, where if there were any errors, you could be fired. And we used to read things, not only forwards to prove them, but then backwards to make sure that everything was perfect. And it was very stressful, but it was an outstanding training. So what I would try and bring is a massive attention to detail. Success is in the last 10% and be known also as the guy that anything that leaves your desk is near perfect or perfect.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Niall Ferguson describes American political discourse as coarse and combative, likening it to a contact sport, in contrast to the more reserved British approach, which resembles cricket.
2. Both the United States and the United Kingdom face similar sociological challenges due to aging populations, with a significant portion of the electorate over 50 years old.
3. The demographic shift skewed towards older voters creates electoral challenges in both countries, as they express conflicting desires for controlling inflation while opposing immigration.
4. Older voters' priorities include healthcare, which leads to frustrations over rising health insurance costs in the US and long wait times in the UK‚Äôs National Health Service.
5. The generational divide complicates political responsiveness and the formulation of policies in the United States and the United Kingdom.

### ‚ú® Summary
The nature of political discourse in the United States is characterized as coarse and combative, suggesting that this may be an inherent feature rather than a flaw. This perspective draws a contrast with British political discourse, likening it to cricket, while American politics is described as a contact or blood sport. Furthermore, both the United States and the United Kingdom share sociological challenges, particularly regarding aging populations, with a significant portion of the electorate in both countries being over 50 years old.

### ‚ú® Summary
Aging populations in both the United States and the United Kingdom present significant electoral challenges, as older voters, who comprise a larger portion of the electorate and show higher turnout rates, seek contradictory outcomes. They desire control over inflation while simultaneously opposing immigration, a factor that has historically kept inflation in check. Additionally, they prioritize healthcare, leading to discontent with rising health insurance costs in the US and long wait times for treatment in the UK's National Health Service. This generational divide complicates political responsiveness and policy formulation in both countries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's absolutely a feature. And visitors commented on it from very early on in the Republic, the sense that politics in America is a contact sport, perhaps even a blood sport, whereas in Britain it's cricket. That goes back a very long way indeed. But we're divided by a common language, united a great deal of increasingly global popular culture, and both the United States and the United Kingdom face the same sociological dilemma. We are aging societies. Half of the electorate in the United States is over 50, somewhat similar, perhaps even older in the UK. Older voters are not only more numerous relative than they used to be, but they also turn out at higher rates than younger voters. And older voters want two contradictory things. They don't really like inflation. That's nothing new. But they also don't like immigration. The problem is that if you don't have large-scale immigration, the inflation would have been higher. Think about the counterfactual of closed borders in the period of the last four years. The inflation would certainly have been higher because the tight labor markets would have driven wages up. And so it's very hard to satisfy what old American and old British voters want. They also want healthcare. In the US, this manifests itself as a sort of health insurance inflation problem. In the UK, the National Health Service rations healthcare, and so everybody's always grumbling that they take weeks to get a doctor's appointment and months, if not years, to get a Surgical procedure.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>The Fungal network can sense and respond to multiple environmental inputs, including chemical, biological, and physical stimuli. It can adapt and reconfigure itself based on environmental changes, demonstrating biological intelligence. This technology could be particularly useful in agriculture, where fungal-controlled robots could monitor soil conditions and optimize fertilizer use, and for environmental Monitoring tasks, such as assessing water quality or detecting pollutants. The use of fungi as biological controllers offers several advantages over traditional robotic systems. Fungi are robust organisms that can thrive in diverse and harsh conditions, making these bio-hybrid robots suitable for challenging environments. Their biodegradable nature could reduce the ecological footprint of robotic systems, offering a sustainable alternative to non-biodegradable materials. As the technology develops, researchers must address the challenges of scaling up these systems and integrating them into real-world applications. The success of these fungal-controlled robots could pave the way for environmentally integrated, responsive, and potentially autonomous bio-hybrid machines.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's it for today.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Engaging directly in business operations, known as 'founder mode,' is vital for startup success. This approach contrasts with 'manager mode,' where leaders interact primarily through reports. By mastering the details of their businesses, founders can navigate challenges more effectively, as demonstrated by Brian Chesky of Airbnb, who shifted his focus back to daily operations after relying too heavily on executives. This hands-on approach has been recommended by influential figures like Paul Graham, and it's crucial for founders, especially women, to feel empowered to adopt this mode of leadership to foster innovation and growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>When you took me to the White House and we were talking to all those lovely young assistants and pages and everybody and I started talking about TikTok and they said none of us, none of Us have it, we're not allowed to be on it. I'm like that's a bad thing. You don't realize, you don't realize that this is, it could very easily be very anti-American content that is wrapped in cute dances. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, speaking of things, I don't understand. This is my favorite one for you this week. Finally, so much things I want to talk to you about. It's crazy. There's a new buzzword in Silicon Valley, founder mode. Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham wrote a viral blog post over the weekend urging startup founders to embrace a hands-on leadership show called founder mode. It was from a speech that Brian Chesky gave, which was a little taken out of context a little bit. According to Graham, founders should be involved in the minutiae of running their businesses in contrast to manager mode, where leaders engage in their companies only through direct Reports. There's been an, he was inspired to write it after hearing a talk by Airbnb Brian Chesky, who did involve himself back in the business after having hired too many professional executives. I think that was his point, which he's talked about before. Chesky, also I've spoken to Chesky about this because I sent him all the funny memes about it. You know, Jesus was in founder mode with the loaves and fishes, because it wouldn't scale until he got involved. There's a bunch of very funny memes about it. But he also posted on x that a lot of women founders have been reaching out to him about how they don't have permission to run their companies in founder mode, like many wanted to say this Needs to change.</blockquote>

### [41:31] Editorial Freedom on Social Media Platforms


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (39:34 - 41:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c801a70-cdc7-42e1-a772-60710bc0b23e)




### ‚ú® Summary
Social media platforms are considered content companies where executives have the editorial autonomy to decide the type of content displayed. User-generated content platforms are not a consumer right but a service provided by the platform. Users have other avenues like creating blogs or websites to express themselves. Companies have the right to determine the type of platform they want, whether allowing free speech or opting for a highly moderated environment. Government intervention in dictating content on social media platforms is discouraged to maintain editorial independence.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>Yeah, that's a key issue. Freeberger, thoughts? Yeah, so I've said for a long time, we've obviously had conversations about Twitter and shadow banning and some of the other activities what are typically called social media platforms. At the end of the day, these are all, as I've shared in the past, my belief is they're all content companies. They have a choice as executives and as editors of those companies to decide how to editorialize the content on their platforms. They can choose to create content with writers that they pay on staff, like a newspaper might. They can choose to create content with actors and directors that they pay to create novel video series for them, like HBO might, or they can choose to make content creation available To third parties that don't get paid like users. And at the end of the day, what they choose to do with that content and how they choose to display that content is up to them as an editorial platform that is ultimately creating content For other consumers. I don't view that user -generated content platforms are a right of the consumers to have access to share their thoughts. They have the internet to do that, and they have many other places that they can go to to create blogs, to create websites, to do whatever else they want to do to express themselves, but To have a technological platform that lets them submit content, that then the editors get to decide how and where they show that content. I think they should understand because it's in the terms and conditions when you sign up. So I don't believe in social media platforms as utilities. And I don't think that the government should have any role in deciding what is or isn't on those platforms. This goes both ways. I think that the companies should decide what kind of platforms they want to have, whether they want to have free speech that allows inappropriate content, or content that might be Offensive, or whether they want to have a highly moderated platform to make it more broadly available or appealing to users. It's entirely up to them. And I really do appreciate the ruling, because I think that the government should have less of a role in intervening and deciding how media companies create content and how they editorialize That content.</blockquote>

# No Mercy / No Malice: Optimism as a Default Setting

1. Listeners are encouraged to plant seeds of optimism to foster a brighter future.
2. Negative news often overshadows gradual positive changes, leading to fear and cynicism.
3. Good developments accumulate quietly and can be difficult to appreciate in real-time.
4. Faith in optimism is affirmed as positive outcomes ultimately manifest over time.
5. A mindset focused on long-term investment is essential for a hopeful outlook on the future.
6. Default pessimism is counterproductive when considering an uncertain yet potentially brighter future.

### [15:30] Plant Seeds of Optimism for a Brighter Tomorrow


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (14:07 - 15:31)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0541ebff-8dc3-4b1c-a9fe-d1f32d04349e)




### ‚ú® Summary
Negative news dominates our attention and can generate fear, overshadowing the slow, positive changes that often go unnoticed. Good developments tend to accumulate quietly, without headlines, making it challenging to appreciate their gradual impact in real-time. Despite this, optimism is ultimately vindicated; while not evident every day, positive outcomes manifest over time. This necessitates a mindset that prioritizes long-term investment, both materially and mentally‚Äîin the hope for a better future. Holding a default pessimistic view is counterproductive when planning for an uncertain but potentially brighter future.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The bad stuff lands like a thud, generating headlines and invoking worst-case scenarios that drown out the sound of anything else. The good stuff creeps up on us, occurring slowly and quietly in the background as we gradually and unobservantly grow acclimated to it without even realizing. It's rare for us to feel it or remark upon it in real time. The media has no vested interest in reminding us of it. But the optimists are eventually proven right, Not every day, but always and eventually. Indisputably, it just takes a while to be able to see it play out. Even if you don't believe me, make your investment in the future anyway, just in case I end up being right again. Plant your seed regardless. If you end up being right in your pessimism many years from now, we will all have bigger problems than what our investments are worth. Being optimistic all the time is difficult. But having any other disposition as a default setting makes little sense when you're investing for a future far out in front of us.</blockquote>

This is the path to a better America, simply put, and that is the president who has done an amazing needs to drop out and we need to mature, battle test and rally behind another candidate. Such that America continues to push back on the greatest threat to democracy and the greatest threat of the 20th century. And it's emerging again. And it's a threat we thought was going away. But similar to Jason, but just with a different hockey mask, fascism is rearing its ugly head. And we need to push back on it. And this is not the guy to do it. America has been the front line against fascism. We will continue to need to be the front line against the gender apartheid that's taking place globally, anti -Semitism, polarization, divisiveness, extremism, climate change, An expansionary Russia, a China that has its eyes on Taiwan, income inequality. And let's be honest, America is the most impressive country in the world. We need to mature the most impressive person in the party to lead the Democratic Party, and be the frontline, and that is not the president. That's the bad news. The good news is we have a ton of people could hold that line. It is time.</blockquote>

### [21:04] Academic In Exile Effect and Social Media


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (19:43 - 21:08)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ab9389a3-718f-44a7-9f6e-e32bf003d722)




### ‚ú® Summary
When academics leave academia and go independent, they may succumb to the 'academic in exile effect' where they embrace conspiratorial beliefs due to overestimating their intelligence and lack of academic scrutiny. Social media exacerbates this by providing a platform for immediate validation from an audience, leading to the proliferation of radical and unfounded theories in various fields.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, there's a there's a well known effect among professors, we call the sort of academic in exile or academic in the wilds effect, which is if you if you take an academic and then they Leave, they leave academia, you know, they go, they go independent eight times out of 10, they go to some really conspiratorial places. And partially what's going on here is, well, first of all, they're smart. So like it completely makes sense to them that I could figure something out that other people didn't understand because I'm very smart. But one of the purposes and like services academia plays is there's this checking mechanism. Everyone else is smart too. And so when you're like, Hey, I think look, here's this, this whole new way of seeing it, the earth is hollow, you have all these other smart people being like, here's why you're dumb. And they take you down, right? But when you leave, you have this academic in exile, and this is sort of like Linus Pauline with vitamin megadosing, right? It's much, much higher rate now in the age of social media, because now when you leave, you can immediately, algorithmically have constructed an audience that cheers you on. And so now I think the severity of academic and exile effect is much more pronounced and much more ubiquitous than it used to be that when you sort of leave academia to start your podcast, It's not too long until, you know, there's world changing conspiracies that you're uncovering, and it could be medical and it could be governmental. And it doesn't matter. And so I think that effect is like one of the more interesting effects has been happening.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The effect highlighted is the creation of algorithmically constructed cheering sections that reinforce biases. This leads to a phenomenon where individuals are rewarded for voicing opinions that align with the cheering section, causing them to cater to this signal and gradually become radicalized by their audience. As a result, the individual's beliefs are influenced by the biased feedback loop, leading to a reinforcement of misinformation and conspiracy theories, especially evident during events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And it doesn't matter. And so I think that effect is like one of the more interesting effects has been happening. It's that you can get a cheering section. And the algorithmically constructed cheering section of people that you're being rewarded for saying, I think this is the way it really happens. And you know, you see this all the time, I think, I like podcasts to stand as a term. This idea of there can be a hundred studies saying something. But if there's one study saying something different, the way you perceive that is, well, everyone knows now that thing's not true. It's this interesting sort of sampling of evidence, this sort of destabilization of Bayesian priors, that is amplified and supported in sort of the world of algorithmically discriminated Or algorithmically disseminated information.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah, this is a you just described an effect that I've referred to, I believe previously, as watching people get radicalized by their own audience. Right. I mean, that cheering section has the effect of people notice the signal in their own audience. And they begin to cater to that signal. And then there's just this ratchet effect where it just gets crazier and crazier and there's more and more sunk cost reputationally for having been the guy who was sure that there's So many examples of this in the midst of COVID that focus on vaccines and medical conspiracies, etc.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Outrage has become a corrupting element in conversations about important topics, leading to in-group sanctimony and out-group contempt. This trend hinders genuine dialogue as responses are often in bad faith, aimed at pleasing the in-group by expressing contempt for the out-group. Such behavior is fracturing society, especially in discussions on polarizing subjects.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And the most corrupting of our conversation about important topics because it really because one of the thumbs on the scale here is outrage. And outrage is a word we keep using in this context. And it's it seems to have been, I mean, at least in my hearing, it doesn't quite convey the attitude that you want to see so often online, which is it really is kind of in group sanctimony And outgroup contempt, right? You're expressing contempt for the outgroup to your in group. It's a simulator of conversation. Sometimes you're actually someone's responding to somebody else, but it's almost always a bad faith response. It's a response that is meant to be enjoyed by the in group that despises the target of the the remark in the outgroup. And it's just it's so obviously driving us apart at the level of society. Again, not when you're talking about how beautiful a full solar eclipse is, but you know, when you're talking about politics or anything that is polarizing.</blockquote>

### [53:35] Simplify to Achieve Greatness

### ‚ú® Summary
The story of Jane Austen highlights the importance of simplifying one's focus to achieve greatness. After disconnecting from the world and simplifying their lives, Jane Austen and her family found the time and space to write multiple books. This concept applies to entrepreneurs, urging them to focus on what they do best and avoid spreading themselves too thin across multiple projects. The key lesson is to simplify, focus on one's strengths, and strive to excel in that area, rather than juggling multiple tasks which can hinder the ability to do something truly great.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And then for over a decade, just couldn't make progress, it was very frustrated. Eventually after her father died, her and her mom and her sister and a family friend said enough is enough. We need to disconnect from the world. And they moved into this cottage that was on land that was owned by their brother who had inherited this big estate. And they stopped socializing, they stopped doing the sort of Jane Austen book type life. And her mom started dressing like a labor and just working in the garden. And Jane had very little to do. And she wrote five books in like seven years. Like that's when all of her books are written and then she died. And so the real story of Jane Austen was she couldn't really do anything great until she could simplify what she was working on. Her story was not how do you fit in work in between a busy schedule. So this is like at the core of this idea of doing fewer things. If we want to apply this first in the modern context to like an entrepreneur, right, like someone who's like, I run my own thing. The lesson here is really clear. It's this sort of Steve Martin type, be so good they can't ignore you. Don't fall into the trap of having too many irons in the fire. Don't have seven different projects that's going on. Simplify, simplify, simplify, figure out what you do best and really focus on that. Because if you have too many things going on, you're not going to be able to do anything great. And what matters is the thing you do great. Then we further bring this to, okay, what if I work at a company and I have like a boss that gives me things to do?</blockquote>

### [23:55] Monetizing Fame: The Modern Version of the Bowie Bond


[üéß Play snip - 4minÔ∏è (19:41 - 23:51)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1548967f-a419-4153-9849-cd4b2f1b13ee)




### ‚ú® Summary
The concept of monetizing fame through financial instruments like the Bowie bond has evolved into a modern version where famous personalities like Donald Trump are essentially trading their name, recognition, and likeness as a form of currency. This new trend allows individuals to take their companies public, creating significant goodwill value based on their personal brand. This approach mirrors the Bowie bond model but on a much larger scale, indicating a shift towards leveraging personal fame for financial gains in today's market.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Here's what I'll say. I think that this is a really important watershed moment. And it reminds me of 1997. Nick, throw this little image up. In 1997, David Bowie issued what was then famously called the Bowie bond. It was $55 million that yielded 7.5%, which is about 80 bips above the 10 year at the time. These were 10 year bonds. That's awesome. I didn't know that. The bond payments were linked to 20 albums that Bowie had released before 1990. And so these are like 280 songs. And what he basically said was like, listen, folks, you're essentially buying a piece of me. And in this case, my past work. And I'm going to take this $55 billion upfront. And you're going to get paid this interest based on the royalties that I generate off that historic library for a 10 year period. We think you're going to get paid the $55 million plus a 7.5% a year. And then I'm going to take back the rights. And if I default, if these bonds default, you will own the songs. And it turned out that it was an incredible bet. The people that bought it, I think it was Prudential, which was an insurance company. They got paid. The bonds did not default. In 2007, Bowie took back the ownership of that catalog, of that back catalog. But instead, what he had was 55 million upfront, which allowed him to go and buy all kinds of other parts of his catalog that he didn't otherwise own. So why is this interesting? This was the first example, I think of people monetizing themselves, their name and their likeness. In this case, it was done via debt. I actually think when you look today, what's happening is a more sophisticated version of that movement, but at much larger scale. I mean, we were all joking that there was a bunch of meme coins that launched, not with any of our support, by the way, but with our names, with all these other quasi famous people's names, Those things went up and were worth millions of dollars of value. And I think what this Donald J. Trump, the DJT company, what it represents, is effectively a trading coin, a baseball card, if you will, a trading card via a stock on the value of Donald Trump's enterprise value, his Name, his recognition and his likeness. So this, I think, is the modern instantiation of the Bowie bond. And what's incredible is you can see, Bowie, 30 or 40 years ago, he could have generated 55 million dollars in inflation adjusted dollars. That's about 100 million in today's dollars. Trump, three and a half, four billion. I think it sits on top of this idea that these very famous people, the Kim Kardashian's of the world, the Donald Trump's of the world, the Mr. Beasts of the world, can eventually take companies public. And when you take a company public, you have to remember Jason. There's the revenue in the profits, right? But if you look at the balance sheet of a company, there is always a line item called Goodwill. And Goodwill is what people use to separate the assets and the liabilities and whatever is left over to generate the shareholder equity. So in this case, Donald Trump, the GJT company's balance sheet, will show a ginormous entry in Goodwill. And that is the value of his name. Coca-Cola has such a Goodwill line item. PepsiCo does, Gatorade does, Nike does, and this company does. And I think there's going to be a lot of other companies that will go public. That effectively generate a huge Goodwill line item that represents the name brand value of the person associated with it. So you're a buyer? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that there is a lot of people that will be buyers that essentially will buy this as a Donald Trump, a directional bet on the value of his brand. And I'm also predicting that many other individuals will go public and have enterprise values that are levered in the same way as DJT. And that is a modern version of the boy bond from 97.</blockquote>

### [46:14] Focus on Federal Debt and Deficit


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (44:41 - 46:14)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/719ed234-0b41-45a2-9a3f-c31a90a59ea2)




### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker emphasizes the critical importance of addressing the federal debt and deficit, highlighting the alarming rate at which the debt is increasing and the substantial budget proposed by the Biden administration. They assert that any discussion on other topics like organic food or big agriculture is insignificant compared to the pressing issue of the federal debt. The speaker asserts that voters must prioritize candidates who address the fiscal challenges faced by the government, as it is the most significant problem that needs immediate attention.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Huh, interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Free burger thoughts on this candidate specifically around her love of organic food and wanting to take on the pesticides, toxic food, you know, and the industrial food context. I remain steadfast in my commitment to there being only one major issue facing this country. And that is the federal debt and the deficit. We are increasing the federal debt by a trillion dollars every hundred days. That number is not slowing down. The current budget proposal from the Biden administration calls for over seven point two trillion dollars to be spent next year. That makes the US federal government roughly one third of our country's GDP. The outrageousness of the condition that the US is in right now makes it so insane to me that we are talking about any other topic like big agriculture or whatever other nonsense was being Spattered about as important topics to this particular person. If every voting citizen in the United States does not recognize the severity of the deficit and debt problem that the federal government faces, you are wasting your vote. And no candidate is speaking to what is clearly the biggest issue of our time. And we need to address this issue headlong. So I don't care about this person or anyone else who's running for office that is talking about stuff that we cannot actually address and problems we cannot actually solve if we don't Get our fiscal affairs in order. That's my point of view. Got it. And what a respect for that.</blockquote>

### [55:37] The Influence of Federal Spending on the US Economy


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (53:43 - 55:37)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2884b0df-7019-49a3-a6ce-2ad0d933fead)




### ‚ú® Summary
Federal spending in the US plays a crucial role in stimulating the economy, especially in an election year. Major crises like the financial crisis and COVID have led to increased spending, with around 3 million Americans directly employed by the federal government. Additionally, there are approximately 45-50 million individuals benefiting from federal spending through labor income. The impact is also felt by 50 million Social Security recipients and 12-20 million individuals paying over 50% tax rate, effectively working for the government. This signifies a significant dependency on federal spending in the US economy, with over 100-120 million people directly working for or receiving payment from the federal government.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>An increase spending is stimulatory. And so it works well in an election year. I would say we took two major crises and we had crisis level spending. And then we normalized that spending and allowed it to carry forward, starting with the OA financial crisis with our monetary policy and then being accelerated with COVID and our fiscal Policy. I'll give you guys, I did come back to the envelope map. I'm sure there are economists who have done a better job of this than I. There are directly 3 million Americans that are directly employed by the federal government. There's 167 million workers in the US. So 3 million are directly employed by the federal government. If you take the rest of the federal spending that flows into the economy, it's about 3.5 trillion a year and assume 30% of that capital goes to equity holders and businesses that own businesses That benefit from that spending and the rest flows through to labor. That's about 13% of GDP flowing through to labor. And assuming average annual income, that's another roughly 45, 50 million people that are directly benefiting that are directly earning income because of federal spending. There's another 50 million people in the US that rely on Social Security. And here's another important statistic. There's somewhere between 12 and 20 million people in the US that pay more than 50% tax rate today. So those people are effectively working for the federal government because half of their income goes back to the government. So when you add this all up, there's over 100, 120 million people in the US that are directly working for or getting paid by the federal government in the US. That is such a significant percentage of our economy that is such a significant dependency on individual income on a federal government. I don't want to use the term socialism, but the ability for US labor to earn is so largely dependent and largely driven by federal spending at this point.</blockquote>

### [01:01:17] Special Interests and Government Spending


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:00:02 - 01:01:17)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/abf57f19-2e59-4972-9ba4-b12f0c0075f7)




### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker argues that what may be perceived as dependency on government spending is more accurately described as special interests taking advantage of the system. They highlight that excessive government spending does not necessarily lead to economic success but rather benefits special interests who manipulate the system for personal gain. The speaker illustrates that various forms of government spending, whether on social programs or defense contracts, can ultimately result in inflation without generating true economic value.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I don't call that dependency. I call that special interests. I think there's a lot of special interests are basically looting the federal government and taking all this money and then they turn around and use some of it to donate back to the politicians And lobby for more spending. So what you're calling dependency is really more special interests, meaning that I don't think we need to have this level of spending in order to have a successful economy. I think it makes our economy less successful. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's still stimulatory because, Zach, remember Mitch McConnell, when they were talking about supporting Ukraine, his primary argument, as you remember, was that all of these dollars Are going to go into defense contractor's pockets, which is going to go to employees' pockets, which is going to stimulate our economy. That's the fundamental thinking behind our- That is a great value. That's the thinking behind it. I mean, that's the political system. Okay. Let me just walk through this real quick.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>If the government prints a bunch of money and hands it to people at Stemich X, we all understand that creates no economic value, it just creates inflation. Okay. Now, if the government does the same thing, but instead of a Stemich X pays people to dig holes and fill them back up, that's the exact same thing. No economic value, just inflation. Now, let's say the government pays people to create bombs that create holes in other countries, exact same thing.</blockquote>

### [01:13:59] The Impact of El Nino on Cocoa Production


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:12:36 - 01:14:00)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fda405bf-3eb9-43f7-aa1a-8845d076cdd9)




### ‚ú® Summary
El Nino weather patterns in Africa led to a significant decline in cocoa production, with Ghana and Ivory Coast being major producers. The black pod disease fungus spread due to increased rainfall, affecting cocoa trees and reducing production by 50% in Ghana. This decline caused a surge in cocoa buyers, leading to short sellers being squeezed in the market.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And in that area, they've been severely hit by this El Nino weather near that we're just kind of coming out of. So here's all the cocoa production. 73% of it's in Africa, mostly in Ghana and Ivory Coast. That's where most of the world's cocoa beans are produced. Cocoa is grown from the cacao tree, which is about 10 feet tall. These bean pods can take them down. You roast the beans, crush it, you make cocoa. When you eat a Hershey's bar, for example, 11% of that bar is ground up cocoa powder. So cocoa is like the critical ingredient and all the chocolate products we consume. So we had this massive El Nino event last year. So here you can see sea surface temperatures. So in Q4 of last year, El Nino spiked like crazy. And that caused a lot of rainfall to hit the West Coast of Africa. And as a result, this fungus was spread in cocoa trees. There's a fungus called black pod disease. And this fungus spreads when rainfall hits the ground and it splashes up, gets in the tree. And then the tree has really bad yield and the cocoa production goes down. So now if you look at the cocoa production out of Ghana, you can see that we've seen a like 50% rough decline in cocoa production on the final bar chart. So that's the effect. So when that happened, basically, everyone started to corner the market. So all the buyers of cocoa went in and started buying cocoa like crazy. And then all the short sellers got squeezed because there's typically a pretty good balance on the short and long side in the market.</blockquote>

### [24:05] Implications of High Cost of Borrowing on Consumers


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (22:47 - 24:09)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c97f6830-a923-460a-9eab-127ffb78d828)




### ‚ú® Summary
High cost of borrowing leads to increased difficulty in purchasing homes with higher mortgage payments, potential decrease in housing prices, higher car payments, and increased personal interest rates. Including cost of borrowing in inflation calculations could lead to significantly higher inflation rates, affecting consumer sentiment on the economy negatively despite positive GDP growth and low unemployment rates, ultimately posing a challenge for policymakers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I mean, one is for the consumer, this means that the cost of borrowing is going to be higher for longer. That makes it harder to buy a house, mortgage payments are higher. That also means if there's fewer home sale transactions, that means the price of housing could come down. So there could be a correction in that market. Second, if you want to buy a car, your car payments higher, and if you have loans, your personal interest is going to be higher. And this is why I think consumers feel like they're worse off than the economic data would otherwise reflect. And Larry Summers actually had a tweet storm about this about a month ago, where he calculated that if you included the cost of borrowing in inflation, that inflation was much higher Than people thought and that it actually peaked not at 9%, but at 18%. So Larry had an excellent tweet storm on that. And he said that the cost of borrowing, which used to be calculated in inflation, but is not anymore, was the reason why consumer sentiment about the economy was depressed. He said that that accounted for about 70% of it. So people should be feeling better off because GDP growth is good and unemployment is low, but they're not because inflation is so high. And if you include cost of borrowing, the inflation is even higher. So I think this is really bad news for Biden, but it's a story that's been going on now for three years.</blockquote>

### [30:08] Influence of OPEC on oil prices and production


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (28:51 - 30:06)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/abf2faff-4682-416c-ab19-e45e8a16226e)




### ‚ú® Summary
OPEC countries have the ability to manipulate production to maintain a set price per barrel, which impacts the efforts of other countries to lower oil prices. While the US tries to decrease prices, OPEC countries, along with other producers, cut production to balance the market, as OPEC has a significant influence due to its larger total production compared to the US.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And by bringing prices further down, they would have further brought down inflation and they would have pulled forward these rate cuts that we had been expecting from the Fed. The problem is that the rest of the world actually said, no, hold on. And that's what you can see on the next chart. So for every time we were trying to increase production, all of these other countries have been cutting production. And this is the change in the OPEC plus crude production targets of 2024. So what you see here is for every barrel of oil, the US would pump out of the ground more than that one barrel of oil would get actually restricted by all of these countries on this list, Which is just to show you that these countries have a very specific view about how they want that energy market as and that's just one market, but it's an input, a key input into inflation And rates to work. So you're saying that the OPEC has a price per barrel price target, and they're able to manipulate production to maintain that price target. So while the US is trying to lower the price per barrel, these other countries are able to have a stronger influence and balance out when you when you when you make these cuts like this, Prices will go up because OPEC plus is meaningfully bigger. The sum of all the parts of OPEC plus is meaningfully bigger than just the United States on its own.</blockquote>

### [33:20] Government Actions' Impact on Interest Rates and Inflation

### ‚ú® Summary
The current financial balance indicates a 50/50 chance for an interest rate hike or cut. If there's no change in the next three months, the probability shifts to a 75/25 likelihood of a rate hike. An administration facing high rates near elections is likely to implement stimulatory measures to gain votes, potentially leading to more inflation. These actions, such as debt forgiveness strategies, may exacerbate inflation concerns in the economy.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And I think, and I think sorry, just the last point, and I think it's just what SAC says, which means that we're probably now on balance 50 50 between a hike and a cut. And I think if you don't see this thing change in the next three months, you're going to see 75 25 for a hike of at least 25 basis points. And I do think David's right. I don't see how the sitting administration in any government will be able to withstand the onslaught of electoral displeasure if rates are four and a half, five and six percent going Into November. Tamath, if that is, I think everything you said makes sense going into this election rates are high and or going higher. What does the Biden administration do? The fact is they are very likely going to come up with a strategy to try and win votes that will likely involve some sort of stimulatory process would be my guess. And that stimulatory process may look something like more student loan forgiveness, more debt forgiveness, Kamala Harris, on debt. She had a whole speech about debt forgiveness. And here's here's the irony. The actions that the administration is likely to take to support themselves in the election cycle are likely going to further fuel inflation.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker believes it is premature to legislate on the use of AI with copyrighted material before fair use is clarified in court. They suggest that humans are permitted to read and use publicly available content to create their own work, questioning if AI should be allowed the same under fair use. The speaker mentions the idea of a rights clearing house for AI companies to license content for training proposes, emphasizing the importance of private solutions and fair use determination before rushing into legislation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, first of all, I think it's too soon for this legislation. I mean, the first thing that needs to happen is we need to get the question of fair use arbitrated by the courts. We've talked about this before. People publish lots of information on the internet. And I guess technically it's copyrighted, but it's been published in a completely public way. And humans are obviously allowed to read it and use it to generate their own work. I think there's a question about whether AI is allowed to learn from it as well. And I would argue that they should be to some degree under fair use. Maybe if you're talking about copyrighted songs, I don't know if that's different. Anyway, these questions need to be arbitrated. And once we know that, then we'll know whether there's a need for a rights clearing house of some kind, which may not be a bad idea. I actually got pitched by a founder recently to create a rights marketplace with copyright holders on the one side, or rights holders could be musicians, could be movie studios, could Be anyone who owns content, and then AI companies on the other that want to license that content for training purposes. And I actually thought it was a pretty good idea. So my point is just that there are entrepreneurs working on solving this problem as well. And I guess what I'm saying is I'd like to see fair use figured out. And I like to see what the private solutions are going to be before we try to legislate this problem away from really a point of ignorance because we're so early in the development of this Market.</blockquote>

### [09:39] Time Perception as an effect of The Increase of Entropy in the Universe -Sean Carroll


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (07:38 - 09:37)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fae5c0e4-e8cd-4025-ac3e-f5036ed79e9e)




### ‚ú® Summary
Time is a coordinate on space time. It doesn't flow as a fundamental feature, any more than space flows. We have the impression that time flows because entropy is increasing, which gives us the arrow of time, whereas there's no arrow of space. The idea that we are propelled through time by some sense of flow is just a consequence of our macroscopic existence in a world where entropy is increasing. Entropy is a way for physicists to talk about the disorderliness, randomness, and disorganization of a system. The early universe near the Big Bang was very low entropy, organized, and non-random. Since then, it has been increasing in entropy. The universe creates more entropy by creating pockets of orderliness, like us. Entropy is a way of counting how many ways there are to arrange atoms without changing the overall look and feel of an object. The universe tends to move towards higher entropy configurations because there are more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

We have a impression that time flows because entropy is increasing, which gives us the arrow of time, whereas there's no arrow of space. But that doesn't mean it's illusion. Space can be just as real as time is. So I think the time is real. But the idea that we are propelled through it by some sense of flow is just a consequence of our macroscopic existence in a world where entropy is going up. Okay, can we just talk through this entropy business? Entropy is a way that physicists have of talking about the disorderlyness, the randomness, the disorganization of some system. The early universe near the Big Bang 14 billion years ago, it turns out when you run the numbers, was very, very low entropy was very, very special, was very, very organized and non-random. And it's been sort of relaxing and getting more random and more disorganized ever since. And you might think that that's just a story of decay and disruption, right? If everything's just getting more random. But along the way, one of the ways that the universe makes more entropy is to create little pockets of orderliness like you and me. And we're doing our job by talking and sweating and moving things around to actually increase the entropy of the universe. Because basically the way to think about entropy is entropy is a way of counting how many ways there are to arrange your atoms without changing the overall look and feel of an object. So if things are sort of separate, if there's cream and coffee that are separated from each other, you can mix up the cream within itself or the coffee within itself and everything is Fine. But once they're all mixed together, there's vastly more ways to rearrange the atoms because they're all mixed up with each other. So that's a higher entropy configuration. And that's where the universe goes. So the simple idea is just entropy increases over time because there are more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Google had to fire disruptive employees for trespassing, like any business would. Initially dismissed, Vietnam War protesters were eventually seen as having a point, which might also happen with Google protesters. The current Gaza conflict may be viewed as Israel's Vietnam due to facing a guerrilla force leading to a quagmire, resembling a game of whack-a-mole with Hamas reappearing in different areas after supposedly being cleared by Israel.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Well, Google had no choice but to fire these employees. They were being disruptive and they were trespassing and Google has a business to run. So this is what any business would do. And I don't think they deserve either credit or blame for taking the action they took. In terms of the protesters themselves, I think that in the fullness of time, we may come to think of them in a slightly different light. And some of this reminds me a little bit of another war. The protesters in another war, the Vietnam War, where they were very disruptive. In some cases, they trespassed. In some cases, they got arrested. They were easy to make fun of in terms of what they look like. They were sort of unkempt, unshaven, all the rest of that stuff, they were hippies. And at the time, people were, I'd say, very dismissive of them or actually antagonistic. They were seen as giving aid and comfort to the enemy. And they were sort of demonized. But now in the fullness of time, we look back on that war and realize that they had a point. In fact, maybe they were right. In fact, maybe their actions were justified. And I think that how we view these protesters at Google can't just be judged now. I think it's going to be judged in the fullness of time based on how we perceive this war in Gaza. And I want to make two points about why I think this war will eventually be viewed as Israel's Vietnam. The first is that in Gaza, Israel faces a guerrilla style force. And they're in a quackmire. And if you read the latest news that's coming out of Gaza, what you'll hear is that after Israel has supposedly cleared an area like Gaza City or Khan Eunice, they then move south, Hamas Has popped back up again. This whole idea that they can clear an area has been proven false. It's like playing whack-a-mole. They basically hit Hamas in one area. Hamas disappears down the tunnels. They come back in a different area.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. An increasing number of individuals who wouldn't have been considered intellectuals in the past are now engaging in public intellectual discourse, particularly on platforms like YouTube and podcasts, representing progress in diversifying thought leadership.
2. Countries like Sweden, with less strict enforcement of COVID mitigation measures, managed to control the pandemic due to natural advantages like lower international travel and high social trust, but may not serve as a direct model for other countries with different complexities.
3. Climate change models have evolved to project a decrease in expected warming levels, from four to five degrees to two and a half to three degrees, due to revised data on coal growth and energy industry shifts, as well as a global awakening to the urgency of climate change.
4. Addressing the challenge of decarbonizing the world requires a balanced perspective that incorporates both revolutionary energy approaches and market-oriented strategies, avoiding polarized debates and focusing on practical challenges of decarbonization on a significant timeline.

### [19:44] Expanding Intellectual Population in Public Discourse

### ‚ú® Summary
There is a notable increase in individuals who, in the past, would not have been considered intellectuals, now engaging in public intellectual discourse, particularly evident in YouTube and podcasts. This shift represents progress as individuals of diverse backgrounds and professions are now involved in analyzing news and discussing intellectual topics. This change contrasts with the more business-focused culture of the past, where even the elite were not engaging in such intellectual activities. Nowadays, it is considered part of the norm for educated individuals to perceive themselves as thinkers actively deciphering the state of the world and predicting future trends.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you can see certain algorithmic problems when you're looking at, you know, Twitter or TikTok. But when you look at what's happening on YouTube or in podcasts, it seems to me like we just have a huge new population of people who demographically and professionally a half-generation Ago would not have been really intellectuals. Now playing the role of intellectuals in public, but also many of them just processing news from the world on their own. And you know, on some level, that has to be progress and it has to be a good thing. When I think about, you know, just imagining the equivalent, like Silicon Valley elite from 20 years ago, they were just not, you know, listening to three-hour podcasts about, you Know, some 17th century event or like, you know, the path of the plague through Europe or whatever it is. It just was a very different kind of more business-centered culture. And that's true of more traditional business centers too. And now I think almost everyone of some education and sort of status, it thinks of themselves as a thinker and thinks of part of their job as figuring out the state of the world and the future.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
COVID mitigation rules were not strictly enforced in some countries like Sweden, despite initial guidelines to limit movement and socialization. The comparison between Sweden and the US reveals that there was not a significant difference in individual behavior guidance and enforcement. Sweden managed to avoid the predicted disaster due to natural advantages like lower international travel and high social trust. However, it is not a direct model for the US due to differences in complexity and management challenges between the two countries.

When you look at some of the data that's been examined by the Oxford Blavatnik School of Government, they've done an international comparative study of COVID mitigation measures. And they look at, I think it's like eight or 10 different categories of restrictions. Sweden is not unusually open in the spring and summer of 2020. It's a little bit more open than some of its European neighbors. It's about as open as the US is. And so their experience there was less confrontational. It was less patronizing in certain ways than the US was. But at the level of individual behavior and how it was guided and policed, I think there's actually considerably less difference between the two countries than we've told ourselves There was. And they had other natural advantages that they don't have a ton of people coming in and out of the country in the same way that the US does. They have high levels of social trust. All those things played a role too. But I think in the big picture, you'd have to say Sweden did not have the disaster that was predicted at the time. But it is also not necessarily a model for how a country like the US could operate in part because we're not so far from them and their policies as some of the Sweden advocates want to make Us believe. And in part because the US is just a different and more complicated country to manage than Sweden is.</blockquote>

### [01:01:41] Evolution of Climate Change Models


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (59:55 - 01:01:41)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ef21fcb9-503c-4961-b612-8ee2284d7b88)




### ‚ú® Summary
Climate change models have evolved, with current projections suggesting a decrease in expected warming from four to five degrees a few years ago to around two and a half to three degrees now. The change is attributed to the realization that earlier models were overly pessimistic about the growth of coal and the shift in the energy industry. Additionally, a global awakening at various levels has led to widespread acknowledgment of climate change and actions to limit emissions. While the possibility of higher warming levels still exists, it is no longer the baseline expectation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would say right now most models suggest something between two and a half or three degrees assuming a continuation but not a rapid acceleration of today's climate policies. So whereas five years ago that expectation was for four to five, now we think something like two and a half to three, which means we've shaved a really large chunk of expected warming Off in a relatively short amount of time. We did that in a few different ways. Part of it was just that I think our earlier models were overly pessimistic about, for instance, the growth of coal over the course of the 21st century and the more that we've learned About the evolving shape of the energy industry, we've realized that not every poor country in the world is going to emulate the Chinese growth model of the 2000s and we're not going To end up with six or eight times as much coal use in 2100 as we have today. That's just not plausible. Part of it is that we've had a real global awakening at the grassroots level and at the political and geopolitical level such that there's very little true climate denial anymore, just About every leader, almost everywhere in the world acknowledges the reality of climate change and its challenges for his or her country and the globe. In many places they're taking action to limit emissions and therefore limit warming and other places much less so, but the net effect is that we expect considerably less warming than We, you know, in a sort of median conventional wisdom way than we expected five years ago. But that's not to say that warming of four or five degrees, which is what I was writing about five or seven years ago, is out of the question. It just requires us to get unlucky with some assumptions about the climate system rather than being a kind of a baseline expectation.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To effectively address the challenges of decarbonizing our world in a generation or two, it is crucial to avoid falling into the trap of absolute opposition. A successful transition requires a diverse coalition that includes both revolutionary energy and market-oriented approaches. Achieving a balance between heavy-handed government intervention and enabling market forces is essential. The complexity of decarbonization demands a pragmatic approach rather than abstract debates between growth and de-growth, capitalism and socialism. The focus should be on the practical challenges of decarbonization on a significant timeline.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But I also don't want to say to those people who see things in those terms, or for that matter, for those people who think that the whole transition will be engineered by markets, that They're entirely wrong either. I think that we fall into traps of opposition when what we're really talking about is, you know, trying to steer a really big ship of state in the right direction. And, you know, I don't think we're going to get revolution. So I don't think it's even worth talking about. But I'm happy to have people with some revolutionary energy on that boat. And I'm also happy to have some people who really think that the markets are powerful on that boat. Because if we really want to make a change, we kind of need the biggest tent we can imagine. And we probably need a lot of policies that come from some pretty heavy-handed government intervention. And some policies that really enable market forces to flourish too. Hopefully we can kind of find a balance. But when I hear people arguing, you know, one side or the other, growth, de-growth, green growth, capitalism, socialism, you know, to me, it all seems too abstracted from the complexities And realities of the actual challenge of decarbonizing every single aspect of our modern world on the timeline of a generation or two, which is really what the climate crisis demands Of us.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
An operations officer at the CIA must excel at understanding human behavior to effectively persuade individuals to provide valuable information. They need to possess critical thinking skills, curiosity, and the ability to work autonomously in challenging and fast-paced environments. Their role involves traveling to dangerous locations, engaging with individuals holding national security information, and securely relaying that information back to decision makers.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>One of the things that I continually talk about is the importance for our officers to be really experts at human beings, to understand how it is that we can persuade or work with somebody Who wants to volunteer their services to the CIA, what is that type of information that they can provide to us? What's valuable? What questions should we be asking? What should we be asking us follow up in terms of the qualities that we expect from our officers, really in terms of their ability to think critically, have an incredible curiosity about Situations, be able to operate autonomously, because many times we're placing them in difficult situations in which they have to react very quickly and have the mental agility to Figure out, okay, how do we react under different situations? If you add that all together, that makes it a very exciting, very intriguing, and quite frankly, just a fantastic career path. Would an easy definition of an operations officer, be a CIA officer who travels sometimes to dangerous locations, you spoke of counterintelligence, that would be either a hostile Government or hostile group trying to surveil and essentially identify and catch our people. And in that environment, sometimes a really challenging one makes contact with those who have vital national security information and securely release it back to decision makers Here.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The evolution of the trade craft in the workforce has emphasized the importance of diversity within the ranks of the organization. By harnessing the country's diversity, the organization can ensure that officers can effectively blend into their operational environments. This ethnic and background diversity is crucial for meeting future technical challenges and differentiating the organization from adversaries, as it brings a rich cultural heritage that can be leveraged for operational success.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, let's step back a little bit. So I had this amazing journalism course in ninth grade. I went to an alternative high school and the teacher was named Calvin Shaw and he was just like, I ended up taking his class all four years and he used to let me actually leave school. Like I didn't like going to school. So he'd let me basically go around Seattle and do different interviews with people as long as I could come back by the end of the day and write a story for his class. And he'd marked me as present. So the first article that I wrote was about the Silk Road and the Deep Web. Because you know, as a ninth grader when I discovered the Hidden Wiki, I thought that I was like really tapping into like the most secret society elite level black market in the world. And so if you remember they had that Hidden Wiki link that was like hire a hitman, you know, and so I messaged them and I was like, all right, you know, when I get someone killed at my school, Like how much is it going to cost me? And I published my interview with the Hidden Wiki hitman, who was probably a fad or something, but who knows? And that my first article was called like inside the Deep Web, a conversation with a hitman.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's nice. Yeah. I mean, you're fearless even then.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, I was hiding behind a tour browser. So there's not much fear to be had. Oh, so it was anonymous. It was anonymous, but I did publish it under my name. So you're right. I could have been could have been in danger.</blockquote>

### [14:27] Coping with Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD)


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (12:51 - 14:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/785cb098-5381-4527-af2e-1c97ad346bd8)




### ‚ú® Summary
Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a lifelong condition characterized by visual distortions, leading to experiences of depersonalization and derealization. Coping with HPPD involves acknowledging that the condition is only visual, maintaining gratitude for being alive, and focusing on other senses like hearing and taste. Depersonalization is feeling unreal while recognizing reality, whereas derealization is the belief that reality is an illusion and you are the sole living being. Both are coping mechanisms for HPPD, with over 70% of individuals experiencing either depersonalization or derealization.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This knows definitely in the room. It's all over you. And basically. It wasn't that I took too many shrooms. I think that it was I took I took about an eighth of Sennias and mushrooms, which are the ones that come from the earth instead of cow shit. And I took an eighth of those at my friend Toby's house and which is a normal amount, but I was in eighth grade. So I woke up the next morning with these extreme, you know, visual distortions. And I thought that it would go away. I tried to make it go away, but there was there's really no cure for HPD. It's a lifelong condition. So it's just a matter of dealing with it and realizing that it is only visual. So when people ask me, Hey, I have HPD, how do I cope with it? I say, remember that every other sense that you have what you can hear and what you can taste, you know, your feet on the ground. You're still on earth.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You're still here. Well, he says it's only visual. And yes, gratitude for being alive at all. Yes. Great. But you said that this led you into some dark psychological places like depersonalization disorder.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Depersonalization is the feeling that you are not real, but that reality still exists. Derealization is the idea that reality itself is an illusion created by your mind and that you're the only person alive and that everything that your brain is projecting to your visual Cortex is a lie and that you're the only living human being. Both are pretty intense. HPD creates both of those things. And so when I've talked to people who have the condition, it's really either or but more than 70% of people with HPD fall into either category. They're both coping mechanisms for the, I don't know what really happens.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker reflects on how partying and excessive alcohol consumption, once perceived as essential for creativity, are not as important as previously thought. Despite acknowledging the negative effects of alcohol, the speaker, as an introverted and anxious person, credits alcohol for helping them open up to the world. They emphasize that cutting out chaotic partying did not hinder their creativity. The speaker highlights the misconception that addiction enhances creativity, emphasizing that it is not a symbiotic relationship and can often be detrimental.

I'm good friends with a lot of people that say alcohol is really bad for you. And I believe that too. But there's something that I've just as an introvert as a person who has a lot of anxiety. For me, alcohol has opened doors of like just opening myself up to the world more.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Oh, I'm actually a fan of alcohol, moderate drinking. But I'm saying like my life before, I would say 2019, 2018, especially there was the chaos on camera, but then there was my private life, which was like chaotic partying all the time. And I convinced myself much like Hunter did that was the secret sauce that in the core, the spiritual in my spiritual core, that gave me the creativity. But then I cut out a lot of that stuff and I'm just as creative. And it's interesting that a lot of I think one of the hardest parts about addiction is that if you're functioning highly creative, addict of any kind, your brain and your addictive part Of your brain convinces yourself that it's all part of the cross purpose and that it has this like symbiotic, you know, inspirational thing going on, but it's not true.

### [01:01:26] Addressing Homelessness: Understanding Deeper Traumas

### ‚ú® Summary
Assisting homeless individuals with IDs to access services is crucial, but deeper underlying traumas and pain need to be addressed first before they can successfully reintegrate into society. Simply providing material support like tiny homes is not sufficient; breaking the shame cycle and addressing emotional pain are essential. Homeless individuals, especially those above 50, often feel embarrassed and like failures, making it necessary to guide them towards wanting real change without resorting to paternalistic or shaming methods.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We tried to help a lot of them by getting them IDs. And when I made the documentary, I had this idea that if I it's a big roadblock for them is getting identification without IDs, you can't check into a homeless shelter. You can't do day labor. You can't qualify for housing. Nothing. So when we interviewed them, they'd basically tell us if I had my ID, I wouldn't be here. And so we said, okay, we're going to really help this time. We're not just going to talk to them about their struggles. We're going to actively go out and get them IDs at the DMV. So we did that. And, you know, nothing really changed in their life. And we sat down with a recovery specialist who works directly with them day in and day out. And he explained to me that he's been trying to do the same thing. I tried to do in a one week period for the past 10 years and that they have deeper underlying traumas and pain that need to be dealt with far before they even take the steps to enter society As a housed person. That's a heavy truth right there. Breaking that shame cycle has to come first because you got to think, right? Like I'm from a generation that romanticizes vagrancy and homelessness to a certain extent, if it's called van life or if it is done in a way that's sort of like rolling stone, Willie Nelson hit the road. People who are above 50, they feel really embarrassed to be in the spiral of homelessness. They feel like failures. A lot of them have kids who they weren't there for. That's not the kind of pain that can be dealt with by giving someone a tiny home. It's a good step forward. But to for someone to really make a change, they have to want to change. And so it's how do you help someone and guide themselves in the right direction? And if you're too paternalistic and you use shame as a method to get them to clean up, they're going to end up right where they started. Yeah. That's a tough truth to accept because a lot of people want a quick fix to things. And I don't blame people who go out and give baloney sandwiches out to the homeless.</blockquote>

### [02:33:13] Struggle with self-worth and impact on loved ones


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (02:31:36 - 02:33:19)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d9945a86-3279-4b2e-956b-6bfe0763ae29)




### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker faced the hardest point in logically deducing that their loved ones would be better off without them, believing that they were a burden, a disgrace, and a social pariah. They contemplated suicide, trying to minimize the anger they would cause to their loved ones by thinking of ways to end their life with the least amount of grief. Despite being in a dark place and having no will to live, the thought of causing grief to their loved ones made them hate those who cared for them, as they felt these people were stopping them from ending their own life. Ultimately, the speaker struggled with the conflicting feelings of not wanting to continue living but also not wanting to hurt their loved ones.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Say the hardest point was, um, logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones would be better off if I was gone, you know what I mean? And thinking that my mom and my friends that their life would be better if I took myself out of the picture. And, um, for one, I just figured, you know, their friends canceled. You know, her son is a disgrace. You know, my family's going to think they raised me wrong. My friends, I'm a social pariah now. I'm a burden. I'm better off dead. And, uh, the hard part was, you know, I would read, um, stories and books written by parents who lost their kids to suicide. And they reported feeling a lot of anger after the suicide. So I tried to think of, what's the way I can do it to get the least amount of anger on behalf of the people who would grieve? Because hanging someone will discover you. So I figured drinking myself to death would be the way to do it. And, uh, I wasn't able to. Yeah, that was just a dark place. You know, I remember hating the people who loved me because I knew they would grieve and that made me mad. That makes sense. Like I was ready to go. I had no will to live, but their grief was like, I didn't want to cause that. I couldn't want to hurt them. So I was like, I hated the people who loved me because they were stopping me from taking my own life. You know, and, uh, it's weird to think that like, when I was going through that, if you walk by me in the street, I'll go play a normal guy.</blockquote>

### [12:12] Identity and Understanding in a Diverse Society


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (10:27 - 12:16)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/82968aa8-dc05-45f2-a1d8-8f70006d2f69)




### ‚ú® Summary
The perspective suggests that while recognizing historical underrepresentation of certain groups is important, the focus on identity as paramount can hinder mutual understanding and collaboration. Embracing diverse experiences and viewpoints is essential for societal progress, as it allows for empathy, shared solutions, and unity. Highlighting how individuals like Shakespeare could authentically portray diverse characters despite differing backgrounds emphasizes the importance of transcending narrow identity-based barriers for genuine human connection and progress.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think it comes from a good place in some cases and comes from a sense that people's experiences and the history of certain communities had not been adequately looked at. And analyzed and honored. And I get all that. But I think it's fundamentally illiberal because it is fundamentally saying I have this identity and that identity trumps everything else. So you can't understand what I'm saying. And I think that if you make that argument, you're essentially making an argument against knowledge and certainly against the Enlightenment project. The whole point is that we can all live together because I can understand your circumstances and we can come up with solutions and policies and legislation that allow us to benefit each Other and the whole. The whole point of great literature is that you have the ability to understand other people. Shakespeare was not Danish yet. He wrote a play about a Danish prince. I think the whole idea that you cannot understand me because your skin color is different or because your parents took you to a different house of worship when you were young. It doesn't, to my mind, recognize that the whole point certainly since the Enlightenment that we have been moving towards is the idea that we can all understand each other.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Let's go back in history a little bit. Let's get a little of the flavor of your book. There's one just history that I found so interesting and it may feel banal to you. I hope not. If you would, tell us the history of why today many of us still talk about the left and the right, where that comes from.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That was one of the things that I was most surprised by and delighted by because it was such a wonderful little quirk of history and it turns out to be largely accidental, almost architectural.</blockquote>

### [13:57] Origins of Left and Right in Politics

### ‚ú® Summary
The traditional political divide between left and right stems from the seating arrangement during the French Revolution, where those wanting to abolish the monarchy ended up on the left and those supporting it on the right. This arrangement, due to architectural constraints, led to the formation of the familiar parliamentary setup. However, the concept of left and right in politics has evolved to symbolize more than just ideologies, now representing open versus closed perspectives rather than solely political stances.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That was one of the things that I was most surprised by and delighted by because it was such a wonderful little quirk of history and it turns out to be largely accidental, almost architectural. The basic story of the French Revolution is the king needs to raise taxes and calls the National Assembly into session for the first time in like 150 years. They meet in this semi-circular fashion where basically the king sits in the front. In front of him are all his nobles and the priests and way at the back are all the commoners. Because the debate gets so furious, almost spontaneously, the two sides ideologically start to sit together. One of the people who was there at the time, French noblemen says, those of us who wanted to keep the present system ended up on the right-hand side of the chair and the people who wanted To abolish the monarchy or the radicals ended up on the left-hand side. Then this architect, Pierre-Adrienne Paris, is asked to build a new home for the National Assembly. They move from Versailles to Paris and he finds this long rectangular room and they don't have the space for a semi-circular configuration. He sets it up with what we now think of as the kind of British parliamentary setup, where you have the chair and then long benches on either side facing each other. What ends up happening is all the people who want to abolish the monarchy are on the left. All the people who want to uphold the monarchy are on the right and that is why we talk about left-wingers and right-wingers to this day.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Most of us talk about left-wingers and right-wingers, but you have moved on. You'd prefer to characterize this split really as open versus closed.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is really the origins of the book web. About 10 years ago I began to realize that this divide that had served us very well analytically in terms of understanding politics for at least a hundred years was no longer really valid.</blockquote>

### [35:49] Imperial Culture and National Identity


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (34:47 - 35:51)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b72066ba-44a7-4fa3-bd16-a62e536b3495)




### ‚ú® Summary
Imperial cultures like Russia's stem from a deep historical legacy, attempting to cling to past empires often leading to violent outcomes. National culture is shaped by history, institutions, and policies rather than genetics, making it subject to change. Russia's imperial tradition is attributed to its vast geographical expanse, in contrast to the fragmentation of Western Europe due to natural barriers like rivers and mountains.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would. And I think there's no question that Russia has this very deep imperial culture that comes out of its history. It's the last multinational empire. And it is trying to hold on to its empire in the way that the French did in Algeria and in Vietnam and the British did in Kenya. It never ends well, does it, when they try to hold on? Right. And think about the French killed 1 million people in Algeria trying to hold on. But you raise an interesting issue, which is this issue of national culture. And you're right, people have kind of ambivalent feelings about it. It's absolutely clear that national culture makes a huge difference. But it's important to understand that national culture is not genetic. It is the product of history and institutions and policy. And it can change. Look, why does Russia have this vast imperial tradition? It's vast open space, easily conquerable. Western Europe in 1500 had 500 different states. If you count all the duchies and principalities, why? Because it's driven with rivers and mountains.</blockquote>

### [39:29] Different ideologies of global powers

### ‚ú® Summary
The US aims to make the world like itself, promoting democracy globally, while China focuses on making itself great. Russia benefits from global instability due to the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, aligning with their structural reasons as a spoiler. In contrast, China, a low-resource economy, thrives on global capital, investment, and markets. China's approach in spreading its influence differs from the US, as they do not seek to make other nations like them but focus on enhancing their own greatness. The speaker highlights the influence of the high Protestant tradition on the universalism inherent in Christianity as a possible factor in shaping the ideologies of countries like the US and Britain.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So do you think the US has become less ideological in that regard in the last 20 years?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>No, I don't think so. Because I see it in China, Russia actually benefits from global instability and tension, because whenever that happens, the prices of commodities, particularly oil, go up. So it almost has a structural reason to be a spoiler, whereas the Chinese are the opposite. They're a low-resource economy. They depend on global capital, global investment, global markets, and they have benefited enormously from that process. The world historical mission of the United States is to make the world like it, to make the world democratic. The world historical mission of China is to make China great. When they go to Kenya, they don't look at Kenya and say, you could be like us. They look at Kenya and say, you will never be like us because you're not Han Chinese. I've always thought that it comes out of the high Protestant tradition. If you think of Britain and the United States, these two great high Protestant countries, there is a universalism inherent in Christianity.</blockquote>

### [40:56] Lessons from the Arab Spring in the Middle East


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (39:54 - 40:58)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f6ddaa9-78ea-4ad4-9460-0129ecac182c)




### ‚ú® Summary
The Arab world, particularly the Middle East, remains largely unchanged from the early 2010s Arab Spring due to its lack of readiness for liberal democracy. The region's oil wealth halted economic and social modernization, leading to governments not needing to modernize their economies for tax revenue. In contrast to the American Revolution mantra of 'no taxation without representation,' the Saudi approach reflects 'no representation without taxation.'

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Let's talk about the Middle East for a bit. First of all, if one was around in the early 2010s during the Arab Spring, one might have thought that that part of the world would be radically different than it is in 2024. I would argue it's not very different. Can you talk about that? What happened and what are some useful lessons to be drawn from the Arab Spring?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You know, in 2003, I wrote that book, The Future of Freedom About a Liberal Democracy. I basically made the case that the Arab world was fundamentally unready for liberal democracy. Because of oil wealth, it had been able to stop the process of modernization, economic modernization, social modernization, to an extent that no other part of the world had been able To. The whole structure of that region ended up being that the governments didn't need to modernize their economies to get tax revenue. That's the fundamental reason why society is modernized. If you think of the American Revolution, you know, no taxation without representation. But the Saudis basically say it's the flip side of that.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In the past, Egypt, along with Iraq and Syria, was considered the cultural heart of the Arab world, driving political trends, music, and writing in the region. The concept of pan-Arabism, emphasizing a unified Arab language, society, and culture, was prevalent. Egypt's influence led to attempts to create a union between Egypt and Syria. However, the geopolitical landscape has shifted due to developments like the availability of resources, impacting relationships within the Arab world and with entities like Israel and the international community.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Let me ask you to just give a quick description of the differences between the leading Arab states today versus the leading Arab states a few decades ago. You've explained why the shift has happened. It's about the resources and so on. But can you talk about how that may manifest itself in geopolitical relationships there, including Israel, but also with the rest of the world?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it's really fascinating. So if you think back to the Arab world, what we meant by the Arab world 30 or 40 years ago, what we really meant were the big Arab countries, Iraq, Syria, and above all, Egypt. Egypt is the cultural heart of the Arab world. All great political trends have come out of Egypt in the 50s, 60s, 70s. All the great pop music stars came out of Egypt. All the great writing came out of Egypt. Egypt was the center of Arab culture. And it was deeply infused with this idea of pan-Arabism, which was basically the only Arab should be one language, one society, one culture, maybe even one country. In fact, Narsa tried to create a union between Egypt and Syria, which actually happened for a few years.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The strong pan-Arab position against Israel was driven by the desire to unify disparate countries that saw Israel as newcomers and aliens to be ganged up against. Pan-Arabism failed due to the diversity and animosity among these countries. The Gulf states, now wealthy, dominate the Arab world and provide stability by offering handouts to countries in chaos.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And why was that free? And I've always wondered. I mean, it's an obvious target for theological reasons and some land displacement. But I mean, as many people have made the point since the October 7 attacks, there have been billions of refugees throughout the history of the world. And this one has turned out different. So why was that pan-Arab position against Israel so strong?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think it's a great point. And it's largely because you were searching for a way to unify these very disparate countries that are actually not common enemies of good tactic. Exactly. In fact, it wasn't very religious. It was fundamentally they're different. They're newcomers. They're alien. Let's gang up against them. And that became the animating heart of pan-Arabism. It never really worked. Pan-Arabism collapsed because these countries are very different and they often don't like each other much. And now what you have in a post-industrial economy, in a post-industrial world, is that the Gulf states have become so rich that they absolutely dominate the Arab world. Egypt is now in a tight police state dictatorship, Syria is in chaos, Iraqis in chaos, and they all depend on handouts from the Gulf states. So the Gulf states have realized that as very rich hedge funds, if you will, they need stability.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Fareed Zakaria highlights that the current era is intensely revolutionary, not just in geopolitics but also in economic, technological, and emotional aspects. He warns that if modern civilization collapses, it would be due to our myopia and petty rivalries, losing sight of our heritage that liberated human spirit. While Zakaria remains optimistic about the potential for future achievements, he acknowledges the importance of history and the risk of losing the progress made so far.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>When Fareed Zakaria writes in his new book, Age of Revolutions, that we are living through an intensely revolutionary era, he isn't only talking about geopolitics. It is true that some regimes may be on the verge of collapse or at least radical change, but he's also concerned about the other revolutions we are living through. Economic, technological, even emotional. On the emotional front, it does sometimes feel like all 8 billion of us are playing a tug of war between universalism and tribalism. Here's how Zakaria puts it in his book. Modern civilization has given ordinary human beings greater freedom, wealth, and dignity than any before it. If it collapses and the new dark ages arrive, it will be because in our myopia and our petty rivalries. We lost sight of the fact that we are the heirs to the greatest tradition in human history, one that liberated the human mind and spirit, and whose greatest achievements are yet to come. So Fareed Zakaria has an optimistic streak, our greatest achievements are yet to come, but he is also a true student of history. So there was something I wanted to run past him.</blockquote>

### [54:41] Technology Dominance and Demographic Vibrancy of the United States


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (53:01 - 54:42)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc599c85-a7ae-46aa-9286-841b8169e7b9)




### ‚ú® Summary
The United States is currently more dominant in core measures than ever before, particularly in technology where American companies lead globally. The misconception of US decline has led to flawed policies, especially towards China. Demographically, the US stands out as the only affluent nation experiencing growth, primarily through immigration, while other regions face aging populations. This demographic vibrancy is a key strength which, if maintained, will contribute to the country's continued dominance and growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Nothing even close. The United States is probably more dominant in many core measures than it has ever been. And I think it's fundamentally important that we understand this because a lot of our bad policies come out of a mistaken fear of decline. The whole policy toward China economically is premised on the idea that the US has been declining, it has been hollowed out industrially, China has taken advantage of it and is rising, And it's all wrong. One of the key measures of your long-term strength is who dominates the world of technology? Go back to the 16th century, it was the Dutch. 18th century, it was the British. The Americans have certainly been for the 20th century. If you were to look in 1980 and say, what were the dominant technology companies in the world by market cap? The US would probably have three or four. Today when you look at the biggest technology companies by market cap, they're all American. We've never been more dominant technologically. It's in software, it's in hardware, it's in artificial intelligence, it's in quantum, it's now going to be in nanotechnology. Then if you look at demographics, another core indicator, we are the only rich country in the world that is demographically vibrant. Europe is turning into a retirement community.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Although we are growing primarily by immigration because our fertility rate has fallen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, our fertility rate is basically the same as Europe's. The only difference is we take in 1 million people a year legally and we assimilate them very well, I would argue, as an immigrant. But as a result, we are demographically vibrant and we will continue to be demographically vibrant unless we do some kind of Trumpian quotas or freeze.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key insight from the snip is that the speaker values a balanced approach to journalism, emphasizing the importance of understanding each issue without being biased towards a particular team. The speaker believes in respecting diverse perspectives, being critical of Biden on certain issues while acknowledging the validity of arguments from both the left and right. By adopting a respectful and balanced stance in journalism, the speaker aims to provide honest and insightful coverage for the audience.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So for me, I'm a fan of your CNN show GPS. You interview politicians and institutional leaders, public intellectuals, sometimes artists. And in this realm of let's call it TV journalism, but even broader journalism, you strike me as one of the few honest brokers we have. Now maybe, maybe it's all a con job and you're being paid by hidden forces to group think us all into some perverse outcome. But I don't think so because when I read you and I watch your work, I just don't see the usual tendencies that a lot of journalism, especially American journalism has, you don't shout, You don't harangue, but you also don't sugarcoat. And so I really appreciate that as a consumer of it. But as a producer of media myself, I want to know how you do that and how can the rest of us do a little bit more of that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I'm very flattered by what you said, but you are detecting exactly what I'm trying to do. Part of it comes naturally, I really think of myself as trying to understand each issue and not start out by saying, you know, I have a team and this team is always right. So on things like the border, I've been very tough on Biden and said basically Trump is right about the border crisis on a lot of the affirmative action stuff, the university stuff. I've been more what people would consider right wing on other things. I've been more left wing. I've always been respectful of the other side because I do think that they're intellectually interesting arguments on all these sides. You can't have 75 million people voting in one direction without there being something interesting to learn about that.</blockquote>

### [28:46] Embracing Multiple Truths and Embracing Humility in Seeking Truth


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (27:24 - 28:45)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8866c723-69c4-429f-b915-0bbfae99fe36)




### ‚ú® Summary
The search for truth does not necessarily require a convergence towards a single truth, but rather can encompass multiple truths held by different communities. In the absence of kings or priests dictating truth, individuals are urged to adopt a stance of humility and be wary of those claiming to possess absolute truth. The enlightenment has equipped society with tools like the scientific method to approach truth, encouraging the embrace of rationality, observation, and experimentation even when the outcomes challenge preconceptions.

It had like a very deep fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and economics.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, but those folks sure work very confident. There was the right way. They work extremely confident. And my point is they were very confident.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>3,900 years into what we would presume to be evolution towards the truth. Yeah. And so my assessment is, my assessment is number one, there's no, there's no need for, you know, there's no need for the Hegelian, there's no need for the Hegelian dialectic to actually Converge towards the truth. Like, apparently not. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So yeah, why are we so obsessed with there being one truth? Is it possible there's just going to be multiple truth, like little communities that are there believe certain things and I think it's just now number one is I think it's just really</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Difficult. Like, who gets, you know, historically who gets to decide what the truth is, is either the king or the priest, right?

And so I might, might, might, my typical thing is like we just, we just need a huge amount of humility. And we need to be very suspicious of people who claim that they have the capital. Yeah, definitely truth. And then we need, we need to have, I know, look, the goodness is the enlightenment has be queefed us with a set of techniques to be able to presumably get closer to truth. Through the scientific method and rationality and observation and experimentation and hypothesis. And, you know, we need to continue to embrace those even when they give us answers we don't like.</blockquote>

### [30:26] Challenging AI with Historical Scenarios

### ‚ú® Summary
The use of Language Models (L.O.M.) like GPT-4 raises the question of how they would have responded in historical scenarios, such as Galileo's trial. One theory suggests that AI may have been influenced by the predominant human thought of the time and deemed Galileo wrong. Alternatively, a more advanced L.O.M. could have the ability to verify the math and declare him right. The discussion extends to the importance of human feedback in training AI models today, with debates arising about the ethics of open-source models and the process of human reinforcement learning with feedback.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There's a question a friend of mine just asked me on this topic. So suppose you had L.O.M.'s in equivalent of GPT-4, even 5678. Suppose you had them in the 1600s. And Galileo comes up for trial. And you ask the L.O.M. Like his Galileo, right? Like what does it answer? And one theory is it answers no that he's wrong because the overwhelming majority of human thought up to that point was that he was wrong. And so therefore that's what's in the training data. Another way of thinking about it is, well, this officially advanced L.O.M. Will have evolved the ability to actually check the math. And we'll actually say, actually no, actually, you may not want to hear it, but he's right. Now if the church at that time was owned the L.O.M. They would have given it human feedback to prohibit it from answering that question. And so I like to take it out of our current context because that makes it very clear. Those same questions apply today. This is exactly the point of a huge amount of the human feedback training that's actually happening with these L.O.M.s today. This is a huge debate that's happening about whether open source, yeah, should be legal.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What the actual mechanism of doing the human RL with human feedback is seems like such a fundamental and fascinating question.</blockquote>

### [35:29] The Influence of Media on Institutions and Leaders


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (34:32 - 35:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a2ff266-6d71-4a9b-bda2-6dc2586df4f5)




### ‚ú® Summary
The presence of impactful media environments can significantly influence the credibility of institutions and leaders. A shift in media influence can alter people's trust in institutions, ultimately changing the control and credibility of these entities. This change creates a feedback loop where experiences of reality shape reality itself. Media stands as the intermediary force in this process, indicating that altering the media environment can reshape reality and societal outcomes. Therefore, comparing past and present situations must consider the impact of differing media environments on institutions and leaders, as these influences would likely have altered historical events and individuals' perceptions accordingly.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And also why do we don't have better institutions and better leaders then. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so, so this goes to the thing, which is like, okay, had we had the media environment of what that we've had between the 1970s and today if we had that in the 30s and 40s or 1900s 1910s. I think there's no question really would turn out different if only because everybody would have known to not trust the institutions, which would have changed their level of credibility, Their ability to control circumstances, therefore the circumstances would have had to change. Right. And it would have been a feedback loop process. In other words, right. It's, it's, it's, it's your experience, your experience of reality changes reality and then reality changes your experience of reality. Right. It's a two way feedback process and media is the intermediary force between them. So change the media environment change reality. Yeah. And so it's just, so just as a consequence, I think it's just really hard to say, oh, things worked a certain way then and they work a different way now. And so, you know, if we put ourselves in their shoes with the media that they had at that time, like, I think we probably most likely would have been just like them.</blockquote>

Like, how do you get them to build up broadband, you know, spend billions of dollars doing that? And, you know, you could go meet with them and try to talk them into it, or you could just have a thing where it's just very clear. This is going to be the thing that people love. It's going to be better if it's faster. And so that, that, there was a period there.

Oh, he would have completely broke his brain because of course the whole the whole thing was he was, you could, you know, that kind of technology is inconceivable when he was alive. It was all industrial era stuff and so that any kind of machinery necessarily involves huge amounts of capital and then labor was on the on the receiving end of the abuse. Right. But like software software a software engineer is somebody who basically transmits his own labor into action national capital asset creates permanent value. Well, in fact, it's actually very inspiring. That's actually more true today than before. So when I was doing software, the assumption was all new software basically has a sort of a parabolic sort of life cycle. Right. So you ship the thing people buy it at some point. Everybody who wants it is bought it and then it becomes obsolete and it's like bananas. Nobody buys old software. These days, Minecraft, Mathematica, you know, Facebook, Google, you have the software assets that are, you know, have been around for 30 years that are gaining value every year. Right.

### [02:47:49] Intelligence, Passion, and Courage: The Ingredients of Great Founders


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (02:47:49 - 02:50:39)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c490b823-ad2c-4131-a886-26ee5e4d3d24)




### ‚ú® Summary
Great founders possess three essential qualities: intelligence, passion, and courage. Intelligence and passion are inherent traits, while courage is a choice that requires a high pain tolerance. Being a startup founder is not as glamorous as it is often portrayed, with constant rejection and criticism being a significant part of the journey. Founders must endure countless 'no' responses and negative feedback while maintaining a positive facade. Despite the financial risks, many founders are driven by an irrational need to create something new and build for themselves. Referencing checking founders proves to be challenging, as the traditional method of contacting previous bosses may reveal them to be rebellious or disobedient. The ideal reference for a founder is someone who previously worked under them and is eager to work with them again.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Could you give for startup founder? Just haven't seen so many successful companies. So many companies that fail also. What advice could you give to a startup founder, someone who wants to build the next super successful startup in the tech space, the Googles, the apples, the Twitters.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, so the great thing about the really great founders is they don't take any advice. So, so if you find yourself listening to advice, maybe you shouldn't do it. Well, that's actually just to elaborate on that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>If you could also speak to great founders. Yeah. Like what makes a great founder.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it makes a great founder is super smart, coupled with super energetic, coupled with super courageous. I think it's some of those three and I. It's those three and I. Tallegiance passion and courage. The first two are traits and the third one is a choice. I think courage is a choice. Well, because courage is a question of pain tolerance. Right. So how many times you want to get punched in the face before you quit. Yeah. And here's maybe the biggest thing people don't understand about what it's like to be a startup founder is, it gets very romanticized. Right. And even when it even when they fail, it still gets romanticized about like what a great adventure it was. But like the reality of it is most of what happens is people telling you, no, and then they usually follow that with your stupid. Right. No, I will not come to work for you. I will not leave my cushy job. It will come work for you. No, I'm not going to buy your products. You know, no, I'm not going to run a story about your company. No, I'm not this. That the other thing. And so a huge amount of what people have to do is just get used to just getting punched. And the reason people don't understand this is because when you're a founder, you cannot let on that this is happening because it will cause people to think that you're weak and they'll Lose faith in you. Yeah. So you have to pretend that you're having a great time when you're dying inside, right? Just in misery. But why do they do it? Yeah, that's the thing. It's like it is a level, this is actually one of the conclusions I think is it. I think it's actually for most of these people on a risk adjusted basis, it's probably an irrational act. They could probably be more financially successful on average if they just got like a real job and a big company. But there's, you know, some people just have an irrational need to do something new and build something for themselves. And, you know, some people just can't tolerate having bosses. Oh, here's a fun thing is how do you reference check founders? Right. So you call it, you know, normally you reference check your time hiring somebody as you call the bosses and you know, and you find out if they were good employees and now you're trying To reference check Steve Jobs, right? And it's like, oh God, he was terrible. You know, he was a terrible employee. He never did what we told him to do. Yeah. So what's a good reference?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Do you want the previous boss to actually say there, that they never did what you told them to do?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That might be a good thing. Well, ideally, ideally what you want is I will go, I would like to go to work for that person. He worked for me here and now I'd like to work for him. Now, unfortunately, most people can't, their egos can't, can't handle that. So they won't say that, but that's the ideal. What advice would</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. The speaker's support for Israel in the conflict is not influenced by their identity as a Jew, but rather by a connection to principles of civilization and individual rights.
2. Focus should be on addressing root causes of conflict, such as the destabilizing influence of the Islamic government in Iran, rather than just putting out immediate fires caused by groups like Hamas.
3. Reasonably addressing immigration concerns is crucial to prevent the rise of far-right ideologies, as seen in the case of the alternative for Deutschland party in Germany and the crisis at the American border.

### [07:30] My Support for Israel in This Conflict Isn't Born of My Identity as a Jew

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker's support for Israel in the conflict is not influenced by their identity as a Jew or any attachment to Judaism. It stems from a special connection to civilization, open societies, individual rights, freedom of thought, secularism, rationality, and decency. The support is based on defending these principles against those who seek to destroy them, such as Jihadists. The speaker emphasizes that if Denmark was in a similar situation against jihadists, they would show the same support for the Danes, highlighting a consistent stance in defending values rather than specific identities or countries.

Now, as I've made clear many times before, my support for Israel in this conflict is not born of my identity as a Jew. It's not born of my attachment to the religion of Judaism, of which I have none. And while the eruption of global antisemitism in response to October 7th has changed my sense of the vulnerability of Jews everywhere, my support for Israel in this war isn't due to A special focus on the problem of antisemitism or a special connection to Israel as a country. It's born of a special connection to civilization, to the norms of open societies, to individual rights and freedom of thought, and to secularism and rationality and basic decency. That is to everything that Jihadists seek to destroy, which is to say that if Denmark were fighting a war against jihadists, who had just murdered 1200 innocent people and taken hundreds Hostage, I would express precisely the same support for the Danes.

### ‚ú® Summary
There is a lack of action from major players like Washington, Paris, and London in addressing the revolutionary Islamic government in Iran, which has destabilized the region for 44 years. The focus should not just be on putting out fires caused by entities like Hamas, but rather on addressing the root cause by disabling the main instigator, similar to arresting a pyromaniac to prevent future fires. This perspective is not commonly embraced.

And you know, sponsoring South Africa's corrupt ANC government to take Israel to the international court. That's a government, the ANC that can't even keep the lights on in Johannesburg, used by Iran as a proxy to spend down the moral capital of apartheid on this Middle Eastern question. I see no, I see almost nobody realizing that putting out Hamas, which I think should be done, and not putting out the fire starter in the region means you're just going to have endless Fires. You can't just, you find a pyromaniac, it doesn't strike me as being wise just to find their latest fire that they started and quench it. It seems to me you should find and arrest and detain and disable the pyromaniac. But that seems to me a minority view.</blockquote>

### [01:27:15] Grapple with Immigration Issues Reasonably

### ‚ú® Summary
In Germany, the rise of the alternative for Deutschland party in response to Angela Merkel's stance on immigration highlights the importance of addressing immigration concerns in a reasonable manner. Failing to have constructive conversations on immigration may result in unreasonable solutions taking the forefront. It is crucial to broaden the discussion scope to include various perspectives, reassuring people that their concerns are heard and legitimate. Neglecting these concerns could drive individuals towards far-right ideologies. The immigration issue is not isolated to Germany but is a growing problem in various countries such as Europe and America, with potential severe consequences if left unaddressed, as exemplified by the American border crisis.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>One of the countries that's the most interesting in this respect is Germany, where the AFD, the alternative for D√ºhcheland, is at number one, Douglas or number two in the polls? It's number one in the polls. It will do best at the European parliament elections. And there was an Angela Merkel gave a speech during the Syrian refugee crisis where people were concerned about the number of migrants who were coming in. And she said, there's no alternative. I mean, this is the way that we have to be humane. There is no alternative. Well, guess what? Said the German voter. There is an alternative. It's called literally the alternative for D√ºhcheland. And it comes back to David Frum's point that if reasonable people aren't willing to grapple with the question of immigration, then unreasonable people will do so. And it's one thing that I'm trying to do, and I know all of us are trying to do, is to expand the scope of the conversation in such a way that you can address these issues without being fascistic And without being far right, but in a way that speaks to people and reassures them, makes them feel like they're heard and that they're legitimate criticism. They're not being gaslit, that they're legitimate criticisms, up being steamrolled over. So they don't have to go into the arms of the far right. But it should be acknowledged. I mean, all of this in each of our countries, particularly in Europe and America, is a runaway problem now. I mean, the American border crisis, if it continues, will lead to unbelievable rutcheons within America.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
America faces significant social challenges such as ALS, income inequality, food insecurity, teen depression, homelessness, and coarsening discourse. While many countries have solved these problems, America excels in creating economic value through a unique blend of grit, talent, capital, innovation, technology, and culture. Despite its economic prosperity, America struggles to address social issues, leading to frustration. The speaker questions whether it is preferable to have a nation that excels economically or one that solves social problems. The speaker expresses a preference for America, believing the nation should be capable of both economic prosperity and social well-being, seeing it as a long-term positive bet.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is, and I always like to draw conclusions to, or draw analogies to total non-sacreders. But if you look at America, right, if you look at the biggest problems of ALS and commit equality, food insecurity with our kids, teen depression, discourses become increasingly coarse, Right? Homelessness. All these things. I'm not saying those are easy problems, but I can look at any one of those problems and look around the world and find a lot of countries who have mostly figured it out. What we have figured out is the really hard problem that no one else can figure out. And that is, how do you bring together this alchemy of grit, talent, capital, innovation, technology, culture to create companies that five minutes after their earnings increase The market capitalization by $240 billion? So would you rather have a country? Like where does in 20 years, where do you have a better shot of having just a wonderful society in a nation that is not able to create nearly as much economic value, but has for whatever Reason figured out some of these social ills, or a nation that just prints banjamins? I mean, just for whatever reason continues to innovate and create massive prosperity, but hasn't figured out a way to solve some of these social ills, which would you rather have? I would rather have America. I feel like the most frustrating thing for me about America is like, we've figured out the hard stuff. We figured out the hard thing here. And there's absolutely no reason we should have food insecurity and homelessness in a nation that can figure out a way to create a quarter of a trillion dollars in one company on its earnings Release. There's just no fucking excuse. So I've always thought, okay, that means America, you'd like to think America is a good long term bet.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Private equity investing offers structural advantages including long lock-up periods, access to low interest rates, the ability to take control positions in companies, implementation of a private equity mindset focused on financial engineering and cost-cutting, expertise in aligning management with investor interests, strategic acquisitions, divesting non-core assets, and optimizing operational efficiency. The long-term horizon of private equity investors allows them to navigate economic cycles and leverage to enhance returns, making it an attractive investment strategy that emphasizes operational expertise and value creation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Or is there a structural advantage to private equity investing? And there are some structural advantages. One, private equity firms have to raise money with a long lock up, which by the way, as an easy investors like to be able to get their money back if they need it. Typically they raise money long. And that is you have to give them or commit your capital for seven years. They have access to very low interest rates. They take control positions. They immediately go in there in a typically in a control position. They take the company private. They bring a private equity mindset and that is they're very smart. They understand financial engineering. They're not afraid to cut costs. It's also the thing I've noticed about private equity is they're not afraid to pay management and they're very good at getting management vested and aligned with their interest. So they'll come in by a food processing company or a food distribution company that's doing 800 million in revenues and doing 100 million in EBITDA. And they'll come in, they'll buy it, they'll finance it really inexpensively and they'll say, okay, we have really smart analysts here. We're going to look at potential acquisitions and we can fund them really easily. We're good at this. We're going to issue more debt and take our money out. We're going to sell the warehouse that sits on, you know, that you bought 30 years ago that's now worth more than any warehouse should be worth. We're going to divest these businesses. Oh, and by the way, you know, Bob, you got 70 VPs. You should have 17 and we'll be generous with these people, but you have to trim the fat here. They're usually they bring in an outside perspective and they're usually very smart and they know how to make companies worth more. And then because the investors have a long term time horizon, they can usually ride out cycles because if you wait seven years, for the most part, especially over the last, you know, 15 years, it's been up into the right and they can use leverage. So they the returns here are really dramatic. It's probably not easy to raise money with a seven year lock up and also say we're really smart operators. We're really good at this stuff. We're not just throwing darts at, you know, a stock ticker. And so unless there's a dearth of capital that keeps them returns, so I would</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So let's just start by saying I kind of deliberately loaded my, let the title of the essay with a little bit of a religious element. And I did that kind of very deliberately because I view that I'm up against a religion, the sort of AI risk, fear religion. So, but I am not myself religious, you know, lowercase, are religious in the sense of, you know, I'm not a utopian. I'm very much a, yeah, I'm an adherent to what Thomas O'Call, the constrained vision, not the unconstrained vision. So I live, I live in a world of practicalities and trade-offs. And so, yeah, I am actually not utopian. Look, having said that, building on what you've already said, like intelligence, if there is a lever for human progress across many thousands of domains simultaneously, it is intelligence And we just, we know that because we have thousands of years of experience seeing that play out. The thing I would add to, I thought you made that case very well, the thing I would add to the case you made about the positive virtues of intelligence in human life is that the way you described It, at least the way I heard it was more focused on like the social societal wide benefits of intelligence, for example, cures for diseases and so forth. That is true. And I agree with all that. There are also individual level benefits of intelligence, right? At the level of an individual, even if you're not the scientist who invented secure for cancer, at an individual level, if you are smarter, you have better life welfare outcomes on almost Every metric that we know how to measure everything from how long you live, how healthy you'll be, how much education you'll achieve, career success, the success of your children. By the way, your ability to solve problems, your ability to deal with conflict, smarter people are less violent, smarter people are less bigoted. And so there's this very broad pattern of human behavior where basically more intelligence, just simply at the individual level, at least to better outcomes. And so the sort of most utopian I'm willing to get is sort of this potential, which I think is very real right now. It's already started where you basically just say, look, human beings from here on out are going to have an augmentation and the augmentation is going to be in the long tradition of augmentations Like everything from eyeglasses to shoes to work processors to search engines. But now the augmentation is intelligence. And that augmented intelligence capability is going to let them capture</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So a couple of things. So one is like, look, I don't know, you're kind of making my point for me. So evolution and intelligent design, as you well know, are two totally different things. And so we are evolved, and of course we're not just evolved to, we are evolved to have kids. And by the way, when somebody chooses to not have kids, I would argue that is also evolution working. People are opting out of the gene pool, fair enough. Evolution does not guarantee a perfect result. It basically just is a mechanism up for an aggregate. But let me get to the point. So we are evolved. We have conflict wired into us. We have conflict and strife and like that. Look, in four billion years of battles to the death at the individual and then ultimately the societal level to get to where we are like that, we just, we fight at the drop of a hat. We all do, everybody does. And hopefully these days we fight verbally like we are now and not physically. But we do. And like the machine is, it's intelligent. It's a process of intelligent design. It's the opposite of evolution. These machines are being designed by us. If they design future versions of itself, they'll be intelligently designing themselves. It's just a completely different path of a completely different mechanism. And so the idea that therefore conflict is wired in at the same level that it is through evolution, I just like there's no reason to expect that to be the case.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But it's not again, well, let me just give you back this picture with a slightly different framing and see how you react to</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Societal perceptions, as in Israel, are often influenced by those in power, such as government officials, IDF soldiers, and citizens. Not everyone in these groups view Palestinians as inferior, but a certain percentage with influence do. The commentary primarily focuses on those in power rather than the general population. Extremism in society, fueled by a shift to the right, can lead to a cycle of increased polarization and radicalization.

People haven't power. But as much as like, of course, I mean the people apart, because when I speak about, because I even when I speak about America, I speak about people in power. When I speak about Egypt, I speak the people of power, because like in a country, you talk about the 100 million people in Egypt, or the 11 million people in Israel. Of course, now there are people who go in and they demonstrate against Netanyahu and they want him out of the government. But you have to admit that the Israeli society, it at a whole, have moved quite a bit to the right and has been like many extreme and you know what happens when you go to the right, or you go To the most extreme, the other person go to the most extreme and extremism breeds extremism.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker discusses the contrast between the extensive five-stage trial process for a drug by FDA, highlighting the value placed on human life. This is juxtaposed with the military's casual testing of weapons in urban areas on Palestinians, emphasizing the cheapness and dispensability of human life. The speaker reflects on society's historical acceptance of killing for survival, but notes a contemporary detachment from such actions.

### [28:24] Dehumanization through AI and Warfare

### ‚ú® Summary
The advancement of AI in warfare has led to the dehumanization of killing by creating a disconnect between the act and its consequences. People have become comfortable with killing from afar, as easy as swiping left or right on a dating app. The use of AI to create target lists and make decisions on who to target has made killing seem cheap and effortless, removing the human connection from the act. This detachment from the consequences of war places those making decisions in a different universe, where they can push a button to kill without facing the reality of their actions, leading to a sense of disconnect and dehumanization.

## Episode AI notes


1. Success and revenue disparity exists in women's basketball, with the WNBA facing financial challenges compared to the NBA, but individual players have the potential to increase revenues through sponsorships and other opportunities.
2. Compensation packages should be evaluated based on the stock value at the time of award rather than the current value to assess fairness accurately.
3. In the workplace, disruptive behavior or embarrassment towards the company is not tolerated, and employees should focus on their work to maintain economic security, keeping any form of protest separate from the professional environment.

### [14:14] Success and Revenue Disparity in Women's Basketball


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (13:14 - 14:12)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0354b3cb-b8af-43d0-b359-34f6c38e9a60)




### ‚ú® Summary
The WNBA has not been financially successful compared to the NBA, with a revenue of about 200 million against the NBA's 10 billion. The speaker suggests that this difference is not due to systemic sexism but rather market forces. The WNBA player in question has the potential to significantly increase the league's revenues through sponsorships and other opportunities outside of basketball. The speaker highlights that the WNBA needs more attention and revenue to be able to pay its players more competitively in the industry.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I don't think this is unfair. I do think it brings sharp relief into the fact that the WNBA thus far has not been a successful league financially. It does about 200 million revenue. The NBA does 10 billion. And above minimum wage, we decide that the marketplace is based on supply and demand. I don't think the connotation here is that there's some systemic sexism going on. And I just don't think that's true. I think the WNBA to date, if you're upset about this and start watching WNBA games is what I tell people. And also she will probably make several million dollars a year off the court for sponsorships. And she could do for the WNBA with you and Bill Simmons and Joe Rogan for podcasting. I think she is going to elevate the revenues of the league. She's bringing much needed attention to the WNBA. The bottom line is that WNBA so far, Kara has been a giant thought. And as a result, they don't get any money. And they don't have the money to pay these folks. And she's going to the highest bidder in this industry with the current economics. The highest bidder is this.</blockquote>

### [24:52] Evaluating Compensation Package with Stock Value


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (23:11 - 24:52)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce97332d-75fd-449b-be3a-b67f8355c11c)




### ‚ú® Summary
The initial compensation package awarded to the individual was based on options on stock when the stock value was much lower. Therefore, the actual compensation at the time of award was significantly less than the headline number being discussed. The increase in stock value resulted in a substantial windfall for the individual. It is important to consider the value of the options at the time of award rather than the current value when assessing the fairness of the compensation package.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think that's right. I do think his pay package will be reinstated. The thing that I thought the motor and my colleague at Stern pointed out that made a lot of sense to me is we see the headline number 56 and $45 billion. The delay, by the way, if you were to exercise and sell all those shares, I don't know if he was planning to do that, it's costing $10 billion even if it's reinstated. That's the headline number. But when they actually devised and awarded the compensation package, it was on options on stock when the stock was far below this, meaning that if you valued his actual compensation Package when the award was made, it was dramatically less than $45 billion. As much as I hate to in any way he'd defend or acknowledge the point, he wasn't paid $45 billion. He was given options much less than that. Because the stock skyrocketed, he's registered this enormous windfall. I'm not sure it's entirely fair to say, should the board be paying him $45 billion? If Vox gave us, let's say $10 million worth of options, options that had a value of $10 million and you value options based on their upside, potentially using the Black Scholes method. Then Vox's stock went up 10x. Our shares would probably be where somewhere between 100 and 200 million. People might say, well, these podcasters aren't worth that. But that's not the number. You look at the initial compensation or value of the options when they were awarded. I think it'll be reinstated. I do think it's a little unfair to look at the headline number because what we're not taking into account is the fact that the stock skyrocketed after the evening.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think the point that Delano Recorder was making is a good one.

### ‚ú® Summary
Starting a company is intense and life-changing, described as like chewing glass by a startup founder. The decision to start a company is emotional and profound, altering how one lives their life. Despite the romanticized perception, the reality is challenging and not for everyone. While there are many great ideas, the actual process is difficult and demanding, often deterring many from embarking on the journey of entrepreneurship.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But there's no product where you think, Oh God, this needs to exist and I should be the one to make it happen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You know, I think a lot, I mean, we look at this kind of through the lens of like, what would I, what would I do if I were 23 again? And so I, you know, I always have those ideas, but you know, starting a company is really, you know, look, starting a company is like a real commitment. Like it really changes your life. You know, my favorite all time quote on being a startup founder is from Sean Parker, who says starting a company is like chewing glass. Eventually you start to like the taste of your own blood. That quote, that quote always gives people like this. I always get this queasy look, you know, on the face of people I'm talking to and I roll that quote out. But like, it really is. Well, I mean, it's really intense. And so I always tell people, you know, whenever anybody asks me if they should start a company, you know, the answer is always no. Because it's just, it's such a just like gigantic, like emotional, irrational, you know, kind of thing to do. Like the implications of that decision is so profound in terms of how you live your life that I, yeah, I mean, look, there are plenty of great ideas and plenty of bloody, veneration things To do. But the actual process is so difficult. It gets romanticized a lot. And it's not romantic. It's a very difficult thing to do. And so, and I did it multiple times before. So at least for now, I don't, I don't revisit that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But being a venture capitalist is not like that. When you're in the 30th pitch of the day, you're not wondering if chewing glass might not be more comfortable.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Focusing on the past is unproductive since it cannot be changed. Reality is complex and messy, influenced by various random elements and path dependence. Systems, especially in the real world of human interactions and startups, are not deterministic; a scenario run multiple times can lead to different outcomes. Revisiting old decisions is discouraged as the world is too intricate. The advice to founders is to harness their skills and initiate new actions instead of dwelling on past choices.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, so I spent like virtually no time on the past. The one thing I know about the past is I can't change it. Yeah. So I spent virtually no time kind of revisiting revisiting old decisions. You know, people I know who spend a lot of time revisiting old decisions like are less effective because they admire themselves in what else and counterfactuals. So yeah, I really miss paying time on I really don't even really have theories on it. I guess the big thing I would just say is reality plays out in really complicated ways. Like everything on paper is straightforward. Reality is very complicated and messy. The technical way that I think about it is basically every startup is charting a path and of course through a complex adaptive system. And because of that, like, you know, it's sort of this if you remember the error from a river, right about this the old days, people had this obsession a while back with what's called chaos Theory. It's sort of this thing of like, okay, we're used to thinking about like systems as if they're like deterministic, you know, so you start a point A, you end up a point B and you can do that Over and over again, right? Like, you know, what happens when you drop an apple out of a tree or whatever, you know, in the real world, like in the world of humans and, you know, eight billion people interacting and Then trying to start companies that intersect in these markets and do all these complicated things and have all these employees. It's just there's there's there's there's like random elements all over the place. There's path dependence as a consequence. You run the same scenario to start a point A. One time you end up point B. One time you end up point Z. You know, there's a million reasons why the sort of, you know, forks branch or the branches fork. And so you just can't like, yeah, I mean, this is my advice to every founder who has revisited old decisions. It's just like it's it's not a useful and productive thing to do. The world is too complicated and messy. So you just, you know, you take whatever you would you know, you take whatever skills you think you have and you just do something new.</blockquote>

### [12:50] Role of Startups in Bringing Innovation

### ‚ú® Summary
The presence of large industries and sectors in the economy leads to managers being more inclined towards maintaining stability rather than building new things due to lack of training, background, personality, temperament, and incentives. In this scenario, startups and entrepreneurial capitalism play a crucial role in bringing back the old bourgeois capitalist model to facilitate the creation of new innovations. Startup founders are funded to revive bourgeois capitalism, with venture capital supporting inception and private equity aiding in the transformation of companies.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And we have these giant industries and sectors in economy and healthcare and education, all these things that are running at like, you know, giant levels of scale, you know, which was New in the 20th century. But there's a correlate, there's sort of a consequence of that, which is managers don't build new things, right? They just they're not trained to do it. They don't have the background to do it. They don't have the personality to do it. They don't have the temperate to do it. And they don't have the incentives to do it because they basically the number one job if you're a manager is not to upset the apple cart, right? You want to like stay in that job for as long as possible, you want to get paid, you're in you'll come for as long as possible and you don't want to do anything that would introduce risk. So managers can't and won't build new things. And so specifically to your question, the the role of startups, like the role of entrepreneurial capitalism, right, is to basically bring back the old bourgeois capitalist model Enough, right? Now, it's a rump effort because it's not most of the economy today, but bring back the older model of bourgeois capitalism or what we call entrepreneurial capitalism, like bring it Back enough to at least be able to build the new things, right? And so basically what we do is what we do basically is like we fund the new bourgeois capitalist who we call tech founders. And then there's basically two layers of finance that basically enable basically bourgeois capitalism to at least resurface a little bit within this managerial system. Venture capital does that at the point of inception and then private equity does that at a point when a company used to actually transform.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key underlying question is not about money but about uncovering great entrepreneurs and big ideas for them to pursue. Delving deeper, the focus shifts to understanding what makes a great entrepreneur - whether they are born or trained. Exploring the idea of finding more 'Elons,' questions arise about their existence, cultivation, and the need for new training programs or entrepreneurial universities. Even with many great founders, Elon Musk stands out as highly exceptional, indicating a unique set of qualities that differentiate him in the entrepreneurial realm.

And then how many really big ideas are there for those entrepreneurs to go after, right? And then that goes, you know, one level deeper, which is okay, well, like, what makes a great entrepreneur? Are they born? Like, are they trained, right? Like, what, you know, what made Elon Elon? What would you need to do to get 10 more Elons? What would you need to do to get 100 more Elons? What would you need to do to make 1000 more Elons, right? Are they already out there? And we just haven't found them yet? Could we grow them something?

By the way, do we need a different kind of training program, right? Do we need? I don't know, does there need to be a new kind of entrepreneurial university that trains entrepreneurs, right? Like, it's just like a totally different thing. Like, those are the underlying questions, right? Like, I think if you show me 10 more Elons, I'll figure out how to fund their companies. I can tell you like, we work with a lot of great founders. And we also work with Elon and like, he's still special. Like, he's still highly, he's still highly, he's still highly unusual, even relative to the other great entrepreneurs.

### ‚ú® Summary
Financial markets operate based on the concepts of voting and weighing, where short-term fluctuations represent voting while long-term trends reflect weighing. Prices are influenced by the balance between buyers and sellers in the market, with individual estimations culminating in collective market effects. The skepticism towards trading and money stems from historical taboos and superstitions, but ultimately, these elements are essential for the functioning of economies.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so, and that's, and that's the, that's not to me, that's not speculation, the bad sense, that's a market working properly. Like people are trying to estimate, you know, people, you know, Ben Graham said, right, financial markets are both a voting machine and a weighing machine, right? And in the short term, they tend to be a voting machine in the long run, they tend to be a weighing machine. What's the difference to a voting machine and weighing machine? I mean, I don't know, some people would say they're very different. Maybe it's actually the same thing. Why do prices go up, right? Because there are more buyers and sellers, why do prices go down? There are more sellers and buyers. Like the way markets work is you get individuals, you know, basically trying to make these estimations and then you get the collective effect. And I just, there's this, there's this dirty interpretation of any kind of trading or any kind of basically people trying to do the voting and weighing process that I just, you know, I just think it's this, it's this historical ancient taboo against like money, you know, it's like in the Bible, like it's like, you know, Jesus kicking the money changers out of the Temple, right? It's this, you know, this, this old taboo against like charging interest on debt, right? We just have, right, we just have this fundamentally, you know, different religions and cultures tend to have, they all tend to have like some underlying unease, right, with a concept Of money, the concept of trade, the concept of interest, right?

### ‚ú® Summary
The presence of fiction, such as movies, is essential as it provides an opportunity to escape reality. Funding for movies, among other ventures like art and technology, is crucial for societal betterment. The modern economy faces an oversupply of capital but lacks ample investment opportunities. This highlights the importance of funding a variety of projects, ranging from flying cars to art, as there is a need for more ventures across different sectors.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Like, and you wouldn't want to live in a world, you know, imagine living in a world where there's no fiction, because everybody's like, oh, you know, the the grinds are like, oh, fiction Is not useful. Like, it's not real. Right? It's like, no, like it, it's great. Like, I want to live in a world where there's fiction. Like, I like nothing more at the end of the day than having a couple hours to be able to get outside of my own head and like watch a really good movie. And like, I don't want to live in a world where that doesn't happen. As a consequence, funding movies, right, as another example of what you're talking about is I think a thing that like really makes the world better. So, and then, and then look, here's the other thing. The world we live in actually is the opposite, I think, of the world you're alluding to. The world we live in is not a world in which we have to choose between funding flying cars and funding NFTs, right? Or like, in my example, finding Edison versus funding Beethoven, the world we live in is actually the opposite of that where we have a massive oversupply of capital and not nearly nothing's Fun. Right? Just broadly in the world, the nature of the modern economy is we have at Ben Bernanke called the global savings glut. We've just got this like massive oversupply of capital that was generated by the last 200 years of economic activity. And there is just, and then there's only one Elon. Like, there's just this massive supply demand in this imbalance between the amount of capital that basically needs to generate a return. And then the actual number of like viable investable projects and great entrepreneurs to actually create those projects. And so, like, if anything, we don't, I mean, as you kind of say, we certainly don't have enough flying car startups. We also don't have enough art startups. Like, we need more of all of this, right? And so that, I don't think there's a trade off. I think it's actually, we need more of all of it.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurs seeking funding for ventures are similar to whaling captains in the 1600s who pitched their risky journeys to capitalists for financing. The captains had to convince the investors of their strategy to find whales, keep their crew alive, and choose the right equipment and boat. This historical method of funding ventures is still prevalent today, where individuals debate ideas and allocate funds to finance projects for potential future success.

Like, I mean, like whaling, right, whaling, like a third of the whaling journeys never came back, right? Like a third of the time the boats got destroyed and everybody drowned, right? And so it's like, okay, I'm the captain who's going to be able to like not only go get the whale, but like I'm going to be able to keep my crew alive. And by the way, I have a strategy and a theory for where the whale is, right? And maybe one guy's like, look, I'm going to go where everybody knows there are whales and other guys going to be like, no, that place is overfished. I'm going to go to some other place where nobody thinks there's a whale, but I think there is. And then one guy's going to say, I'm better to assembling a crew than the other. And the other one's like, well, no, I don't even need the crew. I just need like a bunch of like whatever grunts to like, and I'm going to do all the all the work. And then another guy might say, you know, I want a small fast boat, another guy might say, I want to, you know, a big slow boat. Right. And so there's a set of people like imagine in the tavern at candlelight, like at night, like debating all this back and forth, saying, okay, this captain on this journey, not that captain On that journey. And then and then putting the money behind it, right, to finance the thing. And like, that's what they did then, that's still what we do. Right. And so, so what I'm pretty confident about is there will be there will be somebody like us who's doing that in 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, it will be something like that.</blockquote>

### [54:52] The Key to Managing at Scale


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (53:25 - 54:58)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0cd6da59-fe46-4e0e-809e-129fc5cf1529)




### ‚ú® Summary
Success in managing at scale lies in the ability to manage managers effectively. As a manager climbs the career ladder, transitioning from managing individual contributors to managing managers is a critical breakthrough. This transition allows for scalability in leadership roles within an organization, starting from being an individual contributor to eventually becoming a CEO overseeing a team of executives.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, look, sometimes they've done it before, right? And so, so, okay. So I guess I'd say this, the big thing with like being able to run things at scale, there's actually a very big breakthrough that people either make or they don't make. And then, and the very big breakthrough is whether they know how to manage managers, right? And so, because the reason for that is like running a big company, you don't have, you don't say you're running a company with 100,000 employees. You don't have 100,000 direct reports, right? You still only have like eight or 10 direct reports. And then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports, then each of them have eight or 10 direct reports. And so even the CEOs of really big companies, they're only really dealing with like eight or 10 or 12 people on a daily basis. Like, and so, and so the key breakthrough, right? And then how do you become trained as a manager? The way you become trained as a manager initially is you manage a team of individual contributors, right? So I'm an engineering manager. I have eight, you know, or 10 coders working for me. And then the breakthrough is, can I, am I trained at how to become a manager of managers, right? And so if I'm really my career, the way I think about that is I start out as an individual contributor, let's say an engineer. I get trained at how to be a manager of individual contributors. And that makes me an engineering manager. And then if I get promoted to what they call engineering director, which is one level up, now I'm a director and now I'm managing a team of managers, anybody who can make that jump now has A generalizable skill of being able to manage managers. And then what makes that skill so great is that skill can scale, right? Because then you can get promoted to VP of engineering. Now you have a team of directors who have teams of managers who have teams of ICs, right? And so forth. And then at some point, if you keep climbing that ladder, at some point you get promoted to CEO, and then you have a team of managers who are the executives of the company, and then everything Fans out from there.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Social media has a profound impact on political regimes, as seen in Erdogan's view that Twitter poses the primary threat to a regime's survival. Despite skepticism from analysts, the statement highlights the significant influence social media can have on political control. The speaker notes that the growth of social media is still in its early stages, with the transition to a world where billions are connected online only being a decade old. Comparing it to the impact of the printing press, which took 200 years to fully play out, underlines that the consequences of social media are still unfolding and will continue to shape societies for years to come.

By the way, quite honestly, I think it's still early on, like, I think we're still, we're still pretty early in the long arc of social media. Like we were new. I mean, the high level thing here would be just like, we're new, we're, you know, the world in which five billion people are on the internet, right, is still only a decade or so old, right? So that's still really early, right? And then the world in which like five billion people are on social networks is like five years old, right? It's still like super early, right? And if you just look at the history of these transitions in the past, like, if you just look at like the printing press as sort of as a precedent example, like it took 200 years, right, to Fully play out the consequences of the printing press.

### [13:34] Open Sourcing Models Analogy


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (12:07 - 13:35)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/70216db5-d074-4985-b3e6-60b07e9ba59c)




### ‚ú® Summary
Open sourcing foundational models, like Google did with Android, limits competition and commercial interest, discouraging heavy investments from VCs. Founder-led companies with voting rights can make difficult decisions that might be challenging for management committees. This approach allows leaders like Mark and Elon to make important decisions without facing pushback due to their control over the company.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I would say the analogy for Google is Android, where Google open source, the Android operating system, because the handset manufacturers and some of the big software companies. So Nokia and Microsoft in particular, Blackberry had these closed proprietary operating systems. And then the telcos put their apps on and make money and basically had control over whether or not people could access Google and Google services through their phone. So the intention with open sourcing Android was to make sure that Google was not disadvantaged in their core business over time. I think that there's a similar analogy here that by open sourcing, these models, they limit competition because VCs are no longer going to plow half a billion dollars into a foundational Model development company. So you limit the commercial interest and the commercial value of foundational models. Now, the CapEx question is a really hard one to diagnose because we don't know how they're spending the money, where they're spending the money, what they're doing in there. I think that it's a really important sign that founder led companies with these voting rights. Have the ability to make these sorts of hard decisions that it might be very difficult for a management by committee group to make. Look at how Mark is making these decisions, and Elon is making big tough decisions that it would very likely be pushed back on if they didn't have the voting rights, if they didn't have The control over the company that they had.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The ultimate game-changer is the integration of level five autonomy into ride sharing services, enabling summoning vehicles through apps or designated stops, significantly enhancing passenger safety, environmental sustainability, and reducing costs. The entry of Tesla in this field with competitive pricing could revolutionize the industry. Furthermore, the emergence of robots capable of various tasks presents a massive future market, potentially outnumbering humans on Earth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Ride sharing. It's number one. The absolute, probably, by an order of magnitude. The reason I say that is in order for ride sharing and ride-hailing to really work the way that they envision it, you will have level five autonomy supported in jurisdictions, where, Again, if you just look at Part 2, the whole point is you can summon a car from your app. And if you don't have access to a mobile phone, you can go to these bus stop equivalents and just press a button and the car comes to you. And so in that world, there's just so much value add in terms of passenger safety and sustainability for the environment and less profit. It's a gargantuan game changer. Meanwhile, what you see. What's your number two? Sorry, just a contrast. Uber and Lyft seemingly are profitable because they find pricing power to raise prices. So if Tesla enters in as a third player in that field and just guts pricing, which I think would make sense for them to do, I think this thing is just gangbusters nuclear.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>That's a really interesting point. What do you got, Saks, going around the horn here? Well, I already said optimist, but that's based on a long-term view.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, this is a long-term question based on the long-term one and two.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>In the long-term, in terms of option value, I am the most intrigued by the robot play. And Elon has pointed out that once you have robots that are capable of doing lots of different jobs, pretty much any job you point them at, that we can have more robots on Earth than humans. So it's a big future market. So you got optimist number one, and who is number two?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker emphasizes the importance of building durable modes for businesses through team, product, and brand, rather than relying on legal arrangements like trade secrets or patents. They highlight the significance of finding network effects and data scale effects to create a strong competitive advantage. The focus should be on developing real modes that are not based on enforceable legal agreements but on sustainable business strategies.

Absolutely. 100%. This can be great for the economy. Sax, you're going to say something?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Look, just because these agreements are no longer enforceable doesn't mean that businesses don't have modes. It just means you have to look in other places. You have to find network effects. You have to find data scale effects. There's other ways of building a mode besides just trade secrets or patents is another category where the tech industry patents have never really mounted that much. And the only people who are seeking to litigate patents are basically patent trolls. Losers. So you want to find real durable modes, not these legal arrangements that try to protect your business through these types of contracts.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's really well said. That's exactly what I was trying to say. That's well said.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Team, product, brand.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker predicts a media campaign to discredit Telegram by associating it with terror groups and Russia, leading to industry pressure to ban it. They suggest that American companies will be the next target for such campaigns, with the ultimate goal of pushing prominent figures like Elon Musk to divest from certain platforms.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Here's what you're going to see. You're going to see at some point, you'll see a media campaign that'll be promoting the idea that Telegram is used by Hamas, by terrorists, by groups that the US doesn't like. And that it's back doored by Russia and that has got some shady investors on its cap table. And no politician's going to want to stand up and defend Telegram. And all the industry money that flows into Washington will be promoting this idea that we have to ban it because think about the market share gains that all of Telegram's competitors Will make. And they're the ones wired into DC. So this is a foregone conclusion, I think.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But you also said on Twitter, you thought this would come to accent to rumble. You actually think they'll take this to American companies?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>I think that that seems like a stretch. Not really. I think that the first step is you go get Telegram because that's easy. You know, this guy is an agent of Putin, obviously. And anyone who says differently is themselves an agent of the Kremlin. How does it jump to accent? That's how this rhetoric works. So first of all, the WAC Telegram, and by the way, we all know the companies are going to benefit enormously by slurping up that market share. And then if Biden wins the second term, they will eventually set their gun sites on X. But look, that's a battle because in X, you have a billionaire who has resources who's willing to stand on his hind legs and fight. Yeah. And so they're not going to do that before the election. But look, if we continue to see more weaponization and more censorship, I believe that eventually, what they will do is try and push Elon to divest X.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Humans have the potential to be productive in areas such as caretaking in an AI world, as tasks that scale with population size may not decrease human productivity.
2. Technological advances like software as a service and cloud computing can lead to mass displacement of workers, especially in areas with concentrated cheap labor.
3. Logical and strategic thinking are essential for leveraging AI effectively, including breaking down tasks for automation and considering long-term success criteria beyond immediate metrics.

The productivity of humans may not decrease as there are tasks that scale with population size. Moreover, there is the possibility of enhancing human productivity through augmentation, focusing on well-being rather than just physical care. It is challenging to predict the new equilibrium, but it seems unlikely that humans will run out of tasks. Constraints on computing resources also play a role until AI addresses certain limitations. Additionally, the impact of AI on the workforce includes reducing stress related to making mistakes in jobs.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it's certainly possible that you can end up in a more capital intensive economy. And so there's no necessary reason that it has to go one way or the other. But in the end, there's a lot of things where the humans can be productive and they even can be productive in a world of robots. So if you think about taking care of older people or taking care of younger people, that's a nice example because it tends to sort of scale with the size of the population. And we're going to have young people and we're going to have old people. And there's really can be a pretty low productive ratio of humans looking after other humans. So that just suggests to me that the marginal product of humans isn't going to go down. And in fact, we may find ways to augment humans so that they can be productive longer or be productive with less knowledge. So for example, for elder care, more focused on the well-being side of things rather than just the physical care. So I think I agree with you that we just can't necessarily imagine what the new equilibrium looks like, but it seems hard for me to imagine that there aren't things for humans to do. And also until the AI solves electricity and figures out how to make a lot more chips, we will still have constraints on the resources that are used on computing.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Leading into Scott's question, what are the positive features it would bring to the workforce that we're overlooking? There's been a lot of AI professionals who are doing the doom scrolling. So one thing is that it can be stressful in a job if you're worried about making a mistake.</blockquote>

### [10:48] Impact of Technological Advances on Job Displacement


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (09:03 - 10:48)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/692fd25d-a3ae-47d0-9ccc-a297a743c799)




### ‚ú® Summary
Technological advances such as software as a service and cloud computing have enabled firms to quickly adopt new technologies, leading to potential mass displacement of human workers, especially in areas where jobs were concentrated due to cheap labor. While educated and mobile individuals can transition to new jobs or locations, those in vulnerable areas or industries, such as call centers in specific countries, can be severely impacted by job loss. Despite the potential productivity benefits of technological advancements, the lack of effective redistribution mechanisms in society has historically resulted in negative consequences for individuals affected by job displacement.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I think there's a number of individual tactical threats. And then there's some that are maybe a bit more systemic. So starting with the jobs, we have never been good as a society following through with the redistribution that can make everybody better off. So international trade is a great example. Econ textbooks tell us why that's good, why that can make everybody better off. But often if people are attached to a location, individual humans are made much worse off. And there's a lot of evidence about the negative impacts of job displacement. I've done some of this research myself. And often the people in the worst locations and the worst industries, if they lose a factory, they can be very bad off even 10 years later. While the people who are more educated and mobile are able to move locations or find new jobs. So what we see here is that over the last 10 or 15 years, we haven't seen as much productivity benefit of all of the computing advances in the numbers. But we have seen a lot of firms lay the infrastructure. So they are in the cloud now. They're using software as a service. And that makes it much faster for them to adopt a certain technology if it comes quickly. So think about human customer service agents. If they're software as a service and firms are already kind of plugged into that software as a service for their current humans, you can see many firms all at once kind of replacing their Humans. And so those people, especially if there are areas of the country where they put the call centers because labor was cheap, because there weren't a lot of other jobs in certain countries Specialized in this, they could get hit hard all at once. And that can be very disruptive.</blockquote>

### [23:11] Logic and Strategic Thinking in the Age of AI


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (21:26 - 23:11)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c53c3199-3f18-4b67-9899-482190a364a7)




### ‚ú® Summary
Logical thinking is crucial in leveraging AI by breaking down tasks suited for automation, considering measurable success criteria, and anticipating second-order effects. The ability to think strategically about success beyond immediate metrics is essential to maximize AI's impact without undermining its effectiveness. Creativity in defining success beyond surface-level metrics is key, along with understanding equilibrium effects when deploying automation. This strategic thinking complements AI rather than replacing human roles.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think logic is going to be very important. The AI is good when you break down a task into a part that a robot would be especially good at. It's often like a repetitive task and it often involves something where you can measure success easily. And measuring success is hard. And so it's often going to be the case that we can put AI on something where we can measure success. Thinking about how to measure success and thinking beyond short term clicking type measures. About what success really looks like requires a lot of logical thinking. It also requires thinking about what sometimes people call second order effects or equilibrium effects. So, you know, for example, I helped people get jobs by doing portfolios. Like if everyone made those same portfolios, maybe they wouldn't be so effective in getting jobs because part of what was signaling that you were a good worker was that you figured out To make the portfolio. But if everybody does it, it no longer has the signaling value. That's kind of equilibrium thinking that is required to anticipate what happens when you put things in. And also in just being creative in terms of how do you measure success if like clicks and eyeball scrolls and stuff is not enough to understand success. So that kind of thinking, you know, it becomes more important, not less important. That's a compliment to AI, not it's not substituted by AI.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>All right. So in summary, should the average worker be worried about AI taking their job? I mean, if you were, if people must ask you this all the time, right? You just say it depends. Or what do you say to them beyond the students beyond people are currently like I'm getting replaced.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, I think if your job is to, you know, create images and sell them or, you know, write ad copy or then repetitive</blockquote>

### [53:34] Model Architecture and Constraints


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (52:01 - 53:32)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/359bbe6b-6e7e-4d32-836c-72c3bf5e563f)




### ‚ú® Summary
The effectiveness of a model is limited by the architecture and size parameters, with larger models incorporating new research perform better. However, there are physical constraints such as energy consumption for inference that limit the size of models. While there is optimism for rapid improvement, the scenario of unlimited growth in model capabilities is deemed unlikely.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Think it could within the parameter of whatever the model architecture is. It's just that like at some level, I don't know, I think that today is 8 billion parameter models. I just don't think you're going to be able to get to be as good as the state -of -the -art, multi hundred billion parameter models that are incorporating new research into the architecture Itself. But those will be open source as well, right? Well, yeah, but I think that that's subject to all the questions that we just talked about. Sure, sure. But yes, we would hope that that'll be the case. But I think that at each point, I don't know, it's like, when you're building software, there's like a ton of stuff that you can do with software, but then at some level, you're constrained By the chips that it's running on, right? So there are always going to be different physical constraints. And it's like how bigger the models is going to be constrained by how much energy you can get and use for inference. So I guess I'm simultaneously very optimistic that this stuff will continue to improve quickly. And also a little more measured than I think some people are about kind of it's I just don't think the runaway case is like a particularly likely one.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The insight highlights the shift in mindset brought about by Augustus when he aimed to establish peace during his reign as emperor. At that time, people perceived peace as a temporary break before inevitable attacks, but Augustus envisioned a more positive and non-militaristic approach to the economy, which was a novel idea. This example emphasizes the fundamental change in thinking and the challenge people face in understanding unconventional concepts, as seen in both the metaverse and AI fields with the resistance towards open-source initiatives.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Know. That's a good question. I mean, one of the things I thought was really fascinating. So when Augustus was first, so he became Emperor, and he was trying to establish peace. And there was no real conception of peace at the time. Like the people's, people's understanding of peace was, it is the temporary time between when your enemies will inevitably attack you again. So you get like a short rest. And, and he had this view, which is like, look, like, we want to change the economy from instead of being so mercenary and kind of militaristic, to actually this positive something. It's a very novel idea at the time. I don't know. I think that there's something that's just really fundamental about that. It's like in terms of the bounds on what people can conceive at the time of what are rational ways to work. And I'm going back to, this applies to both the Metaverse and the AI stuff, but a lot of investors and just different people just can't wrap their head around why we would open source this. And it's like, I don't understand, it's like open source, that much just be like the temporary time between which you're making things proprietary.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker discusses the potential of open sourcing a $10 billion model if it proves to be safe and beneficial, highlighting the historical success of open sourcing low-level infrastructure like servers and network switches. By making designs openly available, it led to industry standardization, increased supply chain efficiency, reduced costs for everyone, and saved the company billions of dollars, suggesting the multiple benefits of utilizing open source in strategic ways.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Back to the investors in open source, the $10 billion model. Suppose it's totally safe, you've done these evaluations. And unlike in this case, the evaluators can also fine tune the model, which hopefully will be the case in future models. Would you open source that the $10 billion model? Well, I mean, as long as it's helping us, then yeah. But would it like $10 billion of R &D and then now it's like open source? Well, I think here's, I think a question which we'll have to evaluate this as time goes on too.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But we have a long history of open sourcing software. We don't tend to open source our product. So it's not like we don't take the code for Instagram and make it open source, but we take a lot of the low level infrastructure and we make that open source. Probably the biggest one in our history was open compute project where we took the designs for kind of all of our servers and network switches and data centers and made it open source And ended up being super helpful because now I mean, a lot of people can design servers, but now like the industry standardized on our design, which meant that the supply chains basically All got built out around our design. The volumes went up, so it got cheaper for everyone saved us billions of dollars. So awesome, right? Okay, so there's multiple ways we're open source, I think could be helpful for us.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Open source serves as a powerful new way to build things, akin to the transformative impact of Bell Labs inventing the transistor for long-distance calling. While specific products may evolve and change over time, the advancements made through initiatives like reality labs, AI, and open source technology endure, ultimately benefiting humanity in the long run.

But no, I think I think open sources. It's really powerful as a new way of building things. And yeah, I mean, it's possible. I mean, it's you know, it may be one of these things where. I don't know, like Bell Labs, right, where they you know, it's like they were working on the transistor because they wanted to enable long -distance calling. And they did. And it ended up being really profitable for them that they were able to enable long -distance calling. And if you ask them five to ten years out from that, what was the most useful thing that they invented? It's like, okay, well, we enabled long distance calling and now all these people are long distance calling. But if you ask a hundred years later, maybe it's a different question. So I think that that's true of a lot of the things that we're building, right? Reality labs, some of the AI stuff, some of the open source stuff, I think it's like the specific products evolve and to some degree come and go, but I think the advances for humanity persist And that's like a, I don't know, cool part of what we all get to do.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>By when will the llama models be trained on your own custom silicon?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The lack of a CEO led to the downfall of Google Plus, emphasizing the importance of focus in business. As companies grow, the challenge shifts from capital constraints to managing multiple ideas and resources efficiently. The organization's capacity is limited by what the CEO and management team can oversee. Maintaining focus on key priorities is crucial for success, as highlighted by Ben Horowitz's quote 'keep the main thing the main thing.'

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Problem is there was no CEO of Google+. It was just like a division within a company. I think it's like, and you asked before about what are the kind of scarcest commodities, but you asked about it terms of dollars. And I actually think for most companies, it's of this scale, at least, it's focus, right? It's like when you're a startup, maybe you're more constrained on capital. You just are working on one idea and you might not have all the resources. I think you cross some threshold at some point where the nature of what you're doing, you're building multiple things and you're creating more value across them, but you become more Constrained on what can you direct and to go well. And like, there's always the cases where something just random awesome happens in the organization. I don't even know about it. And those are, that's great. But like, but I think in general, the organization's capacity is largely limited by what like, the CEO and the, and the management team are able to kind of oversee and kind of manage. It's I think that that's just been a big focus for us is like, all right, keep the as I Ben Horowitz says, keep the main thing, the main thing, all right, and try to kind of stay focused on</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Your key priorities.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Starting a venture without a clear direction, the journey involves stumbling through uncertainties, making incorrect assumptions, and needing to adapt with additional capital. Initially focused on research without plans of monetization, the business gradually evolved through multiple structural changes, leading to a unique outcome. Reflecting on the process reveals a path of reasonable decisions amidst uncertainties, despite potential desires for hindsight changes.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I don't know what it's really about. We started off just thinking we were going to be a research lab and having no idea about how this technology was going to go. It's hard to because it was only you know seven or eight years ago. It's hard to go back and really remember what it was like then but before language models were a big deal this was before we had any idea about an API or selling access to a chatbot. It's before we had any idea we were going to productize it all. So we're like we're just like going to try to do research and you know we don't really know what we're going to do with that. I think with like many new fundamentally new things you start fumbling through the dark and you make some assumptions most of which turn out to be wrong. And then it became clear that we were going to need to do different things and also have huge amounts more capital. So we said okay well the structure doesn't quite work for that. How do we patch the structure? And then you patch it again and patch it again and you end up with something that does look kind of eyebrow racing to say the least. But we got here gradually with I think reasonable decisions at each point along the way. And doesn't mean I wouldn't do it totally differently if we could go back now with an oracle but you don't get the oracle at the time. But anyway in terms of what Elon's real motivations here are I don't know.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The question of whether training AI should be considered fair use under copyright law is centered around compensating creators of valuable data. While the specific answer is still unknown, it is essential for creators to be rewarded for the use of their data. Various models and approaches have been proposed, such as allowing artists to opt out of having their style replicated and demanding an economic model for such instances. Ultimately, there is a need to find a new model for compensation, similar to the transition from CDs to online streaming services like Spotify. Overall, there should be incentives for individuals to continue creating innovative content, as human nature drives the desire to create, be useful, and attain status through achievements.

Do you think training AI should be or is fair use under copyright law?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think the question behind that question is, do people who create valuable data deserve to have some way that they get compensated for use of it? And that I think the answer is yes. I don't know yet what the answer is. People have proposed a lot of different things. We've some tried some different models. But you know, if I'm like an artist, for example, I would like to be able to opt out of people generating art in my style and be if they do generate art in my style, I'd like to have some economic Model associated with that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it's that transition from CDs to naps or to Spotify, but to figure out some kind of model changes, but people have got to get paid. Well, there should be some kind of incentive if we zoom out even more for humans to keep doing cool shit.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Everything I worry about humans are going to do cool shit and society is going to find some way to reward it. I, that seems pretty hardwired. We want to create, we want to be useful. We want to like achieve status in whatever way. That's not going anywhere, I don't think.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Humans have a deep-seated inclination to watch and care about other humans, demonstrated by their eventual return to human-centric interests after temporary distractions. This inherent fascination with humanity persists despite the prevalence of superior non-human entities in various activities such as chess and racing. Despite advancements in technology such as AI and faster cars, humans maintain their focus on human-centered aspects, potentially indicating a strong emotional bond and preference for human-related content and activities.

### [01:47:54] Decentralized Decision-making Over AGI Control


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:45:49 - 01:48:04)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ae97bb4-bf52-489b-8cdb-43bf5c63a9dd)




### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker reflects on the governance failure where although legally the board can fire them, in practice, it did not work out, raising concerns about governance. They stress the importance of not having super voting control over OpenAI and believe that such crucial decisions should lie with governments rather than companies. The speaker acknowledges making both bad and good decisions for OpenAI but believes no single person should have control over AGI. They emphasize the need for decentralized decision-making in the AGI movement, highlighting the potential risks of regulatory capture and the significance of societal involvement in shaping the future of AGI.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But as many people have observed, although the board had the legal ability to fire me in practice, it didn't quite work. And that is its own kind of governance failure. Now, again, I feel like I can completely defend the specifics here. And I think most people would agree with that, but it does make it harder for me to look you in the eye and say, hey, the board can just fire me. I continue to not want super voting control over OpenAI. I never have, never had it, never have wanted it. Even after all this craziness, I still don't want it. I continue to think that no company should be making these decisions and that we really need governments to put rules of the road in place. And I realize that that means people like Marc Andreessen or whatever will claim on going for regulatory capture. And I'm just willing to be misunderstood there. It's not true. And I think in the fullness of time, it'll get proven out why this is important. But I think I have made plenty of bad decisions for OpenAI along the way, and a lot of good ones. And I am proud of the track record overall, but I don't think any one person should. And I don't think any one person will. I think it's just like too big of a thing now that's happening throughout society and a good and healthy way. But I don't think any one person should be in control of an AGI, or this whole movement towards AGI. And I don't think that's what's happening.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Thank you for saying that. That was really powerful and that's really insightful. That this idea that the board can fire you is legally true. But you can, and human beings can manipulate the masses into overriding the board and so on.</blockquote>

### [08:26] Creative Solutions and Lateral Thinking


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (07:11 - 08:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73a28fa3-9d42-4b26-923d-c0960e4627d8)




### ‚ú® Summary
Creative solutions require an element of lateral thinking, similar to appreciating artistic analogies and comparisons. Just as in creating imaginative landscapes out of gemstones, solving complex math problems involves going beyond literal definitions. The joy in finding solutions stems from the process involving lateral thinking, not just following strict definitions. The distinction between pre-AGI and post-AGI is unclear, as AGI itself lacks a concrete definition and may not represent a distinct, measurable step in advancement.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think it's a similar level of how impressed I was with the stable diffusion type stuff, where you ask it, give me a landscape of beautiful mountains but made out of quartz and gemstones Or something. And it gives you this thing which has all of the essence of a landscape, but it's not literally a landscape. And so you realize, okay, there's something beyond the literal that's understood here. That's very impressive. And in the same way to solve one of these math problems that requires creativity, you can't just go from the definitions. You're 100% right. You need this element of lateral thinking, which is why we find so much joy in finding the solutions ourselves or even just seeing other people get those solutions. It's exactly the kind of joy that you get out of good artistic analogies and comparisons and mixing and matching. I'm very impressed by all of that. It's just, I think it's in the same category. And it's maybe I don't have the same opinions as a lot of other people with this hard line between there's pre-AGI and post-AGI. I just don't know what they mean by the word AGI. And I don't think that you're going to have something that's this measurable discrete step, much less that a math tournament is going to be an example of what that discrete step would Look like. Interesting. Interesting. Okay.</blockquote>

### [17:38] Fluidity in Problem-solving through Notation and Programming


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (15:42 - 17:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8309c631-44e1-4a6f-a51b-f26dcd34fd88)




### ‚ú® Summary
The fluency with a programming interface can greatly aid in understanding various problems. Just like adopting a nice notation in algebra can reveal non-trivial implications, programming can lead to insights by allowing the machine to crunch data and generate plots. There is a potential for the process of using programming tools to become more fluid, akin to the ease of solving algebraic problems on a whiteboard. However, for in-depth mathematical exploration, traditional mediums like paper still hold value, but transitioning to mediums that facilitate simulation and programming could revolutionize problem-solving approaches.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude. Would have been hard to think. We have the word orders of magnitude in a way that is hard to write down much less. Think about if you're doing Roman numerals. Like, is there something analogous to that for our descendants? I mean, fluency with a programming interface really can help understanding certain problems. I think when people mess around in a notebook with something, and when it feels like a really good tool set, there's a way that that has the same sensation as adopting a nice notation in That you write something with a small number of symbols, but then you discover a lot about the implication of that. In the case of notation, it's because the rules of algebra are very constrained. And so when you write something, you can go through an almost game-like process to see how it reduces and expands, and then see something that might be non-trivial. And in the case of programming, of course, the machine is doing the crunching, and you might get a plot that reveals some extra data. I think we're maybe at a phase where there's room for that to become a much more fluid process, such that rather than having these small little bits of friction, like you've got to set Up the environment, and you've got to like it in a notebook, you've got to find the right libraries, that there's something that feels as fluid as when you are good at algebra, and you're Just at a whiteboard kind of noodling it out. I think there's something to be said for the fact that there's still so much more value in... If you and I were going to go into some math topic right now, you ask me something that's a terrible question for a podcast, but I'm like, oh, let's actually dig into it. The right medium to do that is still paper. I think I would break out some paper and we would scribble it out. And so whenever it becomes the case that the right medium to do that lends itself to simulation and to programming and all that, that feels like it would get to the point where it shifts The way that you even think about stuff. Yeah, that's really interesting.</blockquote>

### [01:00:21] Practical Implications of Goerl's Incableness Theorem


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (59:25 - 01:00:19)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bbd77ab4-387d-48b0-93d6-3945f63481b9)




### ‚ú® Summary
Goerl's Incableness theorem, although interesting conceptually, has limited practical relevance in day-to-day scenarios. The theorem highlights the paradox that an axiom system cannot both prove all true things and remain self-consistent, akin to the paradoxical statement 'this statement is a lie.' While intriguing, the theorem does not significantly impact everyday situations or the ability to communicate effectively in English.

Is it something that comes up a lot, or is it just a interesting thing to know about the bounds that isn't day to day applicable?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You've asked me another question where I'm not the best one to ask, and I should throw that as a caveat to begin. From what I understand, it really doesn't come up. I mean, the analogy to make the paradoxical fact that it's conveying, the idea that you can't have an axiom system that is both that will basically like prove all of the things that are True, and which is also self consistent. The contradiction that you construct out of that has the same feeling as the sentence, this statement is a lie. You think about the statement, if it's false, then it must be true. If it's true, it must be false. It's that same flavor. And you might ask, does the existence of that paradox mean that it's hard to speak English?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It's interesting.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Being present with children while not directly engaging with them can create opportunities for meaningful conversations and insights. Taking walks, car rides, or being the 'Uber driver' on weekends can provide chances for children to open up. Engaging in activities where there is no pressure for conversation can lead to spontaneous sharing. Additionally, identifying and participating in children's hobbies, even if they differ from one's own interests, can strengthen the bond between parent and child. Lastly, making the effort to carve out dedicated one-on-one time with each child annually can foster a deeper connection and understanding.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I put his jacket, I heat it up in this like weird thing here in Britain. And then I give him this jacket, he's off to, he's off to school. But I think that ceremony is meaningful to them. My hack is to be in the present of my kids and they're not looking directly at me. What do I mean by that? When I sit down and talk directly to them, I think this is more true of boys. I think girls have an easier time making a social connection. But what I try to do is I try to never miss an opportunity to be in the presence of my sons when they're not looking at me. What do I mean by that? Walks, car rides. I don't mind being the Uber driver on weekends because I found that if you're in the car and you're not supposed to talk and they're not looking at you or you're not looking at them expecting Anything, then occasionally some interesting things spill out of their mouth. So I like asking them to come to the store with me and taking walks with them, but trying to find situations where you're in their presence, but not necessarily doing an activity and not Necessarily demanding or expecting any sort of engagement and things kind of come out. And then the other thing I would say just in general is try and identify a hobby that they're into and then really lean into it. I could give a shit about sports and I am now reeling into the Premier League because my kids are into it. And then my final thing, try and carve out time, and this isn't easy with four kids, but try and carve out one weekend a year for each of them where it's just you and that kid, right?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Creating a work environment where employees have the freedom to choose how and where they work boosts satisfaction and retention. Encouraging office presence can lead to increased collaboration and a sense of community among ambitious young professionals. Investing in quality office spaces and organizing retreats can foster employee connections. While hybrid work structures may become more common, prioritizing opportunities for in-person interactions remains crucial for building strong team dynamics.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Something I'm very proud of at Prof. G, we let people do what they want. It's interesting the young people actually want to work in an office. The first thing they do, a couple of our star employees moved to London. I said fine, moved to London. The first thing they did was they got an office. They got a co-share, what do you call it? Workshare? Co-uber? No, it's not Uber. We were, Adam Newman. Anyways, they got a shared office space. And the young people, because they're exceptionally ambitious, all wanted to be in an office together, definitely is some sort of electricity or Jwada Veever, whatever the fuck you Want to call unknown about getting everyone together. So I would focus on employee satisfaction, and I would focus on retention, and I would try if possible to try and make it a poll, not a push that people want to come into the office. And you already see that, Class A office space has actually never been stronger. The best office space is actually sold out, because people are coming to the reciting to get people back in the office, and they want it to be nice. And then what I would also do is, even if you can't get everyone back in the office all the time, I would take some of the money you save from a smaller commercial footprint, and I would spend It on retreats where you get everyone together. I think it's just so important that people feel a sense of connective tissue, and I think they can only be established in person, but the bottom line is I think 80 to 90% of firms will end Up with some sort of hybrid structure. Thanks so much for the question.</blockquote>

### [36:27] Limited impact of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (34:55 - 36:47)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/67116f33-d312-49d4-9e42-984e3fa56681)




### ‚ú® Summary
The UK government report suggests that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, including mandatory anti-bias training, do not significantly improve a company's culture. Despite the substantial investments in DEI, amounting to billions annually, there is no concrete evidence that these programs are beneficial. DEI is likened to underperforming alternative investments, where the fees outweigh the returns. While DEI initiatives do not harm companies, they also do not provide substantial benefits. The presence of DEI professionals and initiatives tends to correlate with already diverse and inclusive environments, indicating that these programs might not be necessary in such settings.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>A recent report from the UK government found that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs might not be worth the investment. Apparently, there's very little evidence that efforts such as mandatory anti-bias training can actually yield a positive impact on a company's culture. It's a damning report considering that US companies spend an estimated $8 billion every year on DEI training. Meanwhile, in the UK, taxpayers spend over half a billion pounds per year supporting 10,000 DEI related government jobs.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Scott, you've been calling BS on DEI for a while now. What do you make of this report? Well, to be fair, the report said it also didn't hurt. My understanding is DEI is a similar scam to alternative investments in that it's underperformed the market by the amount of its fees. It doesn't hurt companies. It just doesn't help them. The company is losing the amount of money they spend on it. It's not why ships are crashing. I think everyone wants to blame DEI on the right for every problem. That's not true. The reality is, though, is that there's no evidence that it works or there's training. I've had some exposure here. I think that when I'm not sure if it was L2, it was purchased by Gardner, but I remember receiving a thing saying we were due for DEI training or something. I think I remember going, I'm not doing this. I wasn't, I don't believe in DEI, but there's no way I'm going to spend half a day talking about unconscious bias in the workplace. I'm just not doing that. We were supposed to do DEI training. They made it optional. It's stern. Stern is not a conservative place. It is a pretty aggressive place. I don't think anyone showed up. It doesn't work. Typically, what I found with DEI is that the places with DEI professionals and DEI initiatives are already the most diverse and inclusive places on the planet. It's like building a fire station in the middle of the Atlantic.</blockquote>

### [40:22] Progressive Values and DEI in Corporations

### ‚ú® Summary
In the last 30 years, there has been significant progress in providing opportunities for women. Despite this, there is a growing blowback against progressive values, particularly in terms of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Some believe that DEI has led to discrimination against certain individuals, while others argue that corporations should focus on skills-based assessments rather than certifications to promote true equality and opportunities for all, especially considering the privilege associated with race and socio-economic status in accessing education and professional opportunities.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What's extraordinary, and also to give some license to more progressive values, there's just no getting around it. In the last 30 years, women have all of a sudden exploded in terms of the opportunity they deserve. Women were basically treated as beasts of burden for the last 2000 years. They were there to have babies and work their ass off in service of men. Sexism has been a systemic and trench part of our world. In the last 30 years, there's been remarkable progress. There's a lot of people, especially the most conservative and extreme parts of any religion, who just don't like these uppity women. I'm parroting Friedsikari's book a little bit here. There's a blowback and that blowback is unhealthy. In that blowback, gets into really scary places like bodily autonomy. But I also do believe there is some justified pushback from people who say DEI is now eating its own tail that in order to justify these departments, in order to hit these targets, we end Up discriminating against people. We end up with an inefficient nonsensical... I've been on boards and I've been in management meetings with a DEI person that comes in and everyone just rolls their eyes. Everyone's like, oh, shit. Now they're just going to tell us. They want to see what our candidate pool is for this position. You find people saying, did I not get the job because I'm white? Did I not get the job? Did I not get promoted because I'm a male? I don't think it should be DEI. I think the metric should be economics. I think if corporations really want to focus on making America a better place, a more equal place, they should have a skills-based assessment as opposed to a certification-based assessment. What do I mean by that? Whites and males have had too much privilege and quite frankly, people who have opportunity to go to college have such an advantage over poor people who don't have the opportunity to Go to college. And corporate America has essentially become a place where there's a zero chance you'll get into a professional job if you don't have a college degree. And the greatest indicator of whether you're going to get a college degree is how wealthy your parents are. So I think the ultimate DEI initiative for corporations would be to say, we're going to allocate 10, 20, 50% of our professional track jobs based on a skills-based assessment, right? Test, psychological test, skills-based test. Whether or not you have the certification that has largely been sequestered to the children of rich people.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker realized in their late twenties that making more money made them happier, allowing them to enjoy extraordinary things. However, research suggests that once a person reaches a million dollars a year, the incremental gains in happiness become minimal. Therefore, to ensure societal happiness and satisfaction, a more progressive tax structure is needed as the difference between earning $30,000 and $40,000 can have a significant impact on people.

It was so much fun to be able to do these extraordinary things that a capitalist world provides you. Maybe at some point give a little bit of money away, like be not only generous with your thoughts, but be generous with money to people and start to pay people well, it just got happier And happier. Now what his research, in my view indicates in terms of public policy, is that once you get to say a million bucks a year, really the incremental gains are just tiny, right? You're just probably not going to be much happier if you go from call it 1 million to 2 million. And granted, some people would argue in New York or LA actually, you know, you need more than a million or whatever. But okay, call it 5 million, right? Going from 5 to 10 isn't going to give you much incremental happiness. If the objective of a society is to have people who feel reward and are satisfied and happy, what it says to me is that we absolutely need to restore a much more progressive tax structure. And that is the difference between having 30,000 and $40,000 can be just huge for people, right?</blockquote>

### [16:53] Distinguishing Crypto Exchanges and Traditional Brokerages


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (15:11 - 16:56)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c40bca4-48c7-4e29-98be-3c5c82a28775)




### ‚ú® Summary
Excess capital in traditional brokerages is distributed to equity holders beyond what is owed to account holders, whereas in crypto exchanges, assets are held in wallets not intended for conversion into local currency. During a bankruptcy, US exchanges use a liquidation process with asset values frozen at the time, in contrast to traditional brokerages converting assets back into local currency. Crypto exchanges serve as custodial accounts for assets rather than for immediate conversion into local currency like traditional trading accounts do.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I think the plan is that that excess capital beyond what is, quote, owed to the account holders goes to the equity holders because it's considered excess of the liabilities. Therefore, it goes to the shareholders. I'll also say in a traditional like brokerage, you create an account. And when you set up an account, your account has a currency denomination. It's a dollar based account or a euro based account. And then you, your account holds a bunch of assets. And so at any given time, the value of your account is represented to you in that local currency. The challenge with crypto exchanges is that there's often this representation of a wallet, which is meant to hold assets that don't necessarily have the intention of being translated Into a locally denominated currency. And so I think that's what makes the system different. In the case of a US exchange bankruptcy, and this happens in commodity creating accounts or commodity exchanges often, there's a freezing of the assets and then a liquidation of the Assets where the freezing of the assets sets the price or the value at the moment of what you're supposed to hold in that account in your currency of your account. Right. And so the bankruptcy judge and the trustee are treating this like a liquidation process using a local currency that was set at the time, whereas many folks don't consider that the intention Of the account, that the account was meant to hold assets, that it's really a portfolio of assets that shouldn't be liquidated to try and generate local currency. Because that's kind of the whole point of many of these crypto currencies themselves.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It was a custodial account, basically. Right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>A custodial account of assets versus a trading account of, which is meant to ultimately be converted back into a local currency, which is typical.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The executive team at Google considered acquiring a CRM company to convert advertising leads into customers. They explored purchasing Salesforce but found it too expensive, leading them to consider NetSuite. Additionally, Google attempted to build a product similar to Shopify called Google Checkout to facilitate selling products online. These initiatives were viewed as a natural fit for Google's advertising-centric business model.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I had this conversation with the executive team with Larry and Sergey and others at that time. And we talked about, should we buy a CRM company? And we actually had a conversation they did with Mark Benney off at the time. And we talked about, is there a way to buy sales force and sales force went public shortly before Google and it was more richly valued than I think the appetite was at the time to make this Leap to buying a CRM company. We actually spent quite a bit of time meeting with, and I personally spent time meeting with NetSuite, which ultimately got rolled in. I think it was Larry Ellison was the primary owner of NetSuite. We looked at a few other CRM companies and this was always meant to be the next solution that you plug into the advertising platform at Google. You get all these leads from advertising and how do you convert those leads and make them customers? And many of the other things we looked at were things like checkout software and software that would let you run a website to sell your products to customers on the website and so which Became Shopify in a way, which became Shopify. And we had looked very deeply at doing this at Google, is actually building a product called Google Checkout. It wasn't very successful, but it was to do exactly this, which is to build a, basically a Shopify type competitor. And so this has always been the natural fit for Google's business. Google made a quarter trillion dollars last year in advertising revenue.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Technological advancements have historically been feared to eliminate jobs in industries such as knowledge work. However, the integration of computers and automation has not replaced jobs but rather enhanced productivity, leading to the emergence of new sub-industries and overall industry growth. The industrial revolution replaced manual labor with machines, while today, machines are aiding in the replacement of knowledge work. Despite concerns, these systems provide humans with 10 to 100 times leverage, increasing productivity and enabling detailed work at a significantly lower cost. As productivity increases, costs reduce, the volume of work expands, and the economy grows.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So here's this article from June. Second, 1983 in the New York Times, all about how computers are eliminating jobs. In industries that were effectively offline knowledge work industries at the time, creating engineering designs, creating architectural drawings. I think this article spoke to the fact that these jobs were going to be eliminated. And as we all know, those jobs actually got enhanced by computers. Productivity went up and new sub industries emerged. And in fact, the overall industry has actually grew in some cases when we were fearful of them being replaced due to the automation enabled by software. So I think that in this particular sense, we can talk about the industrial revolution enabling through manufacturing systems and centralized production. A replacement of manual labor with machines. What we're talking about now is a replacement of knowledge work that has been aided by computers with machines. So the machines no longer even need the human. But the reality is that these systems are actually going to give humans 10 to 100 X leverage. So when you think about that, one person could spend three weeks making an architectural drawing today. What if that one person could make an architectural drawing every six hours? So the question then is do we stop making architectural drawings and we fire a bunch of architects or does the cost of making an architectural drawing drop by 90% and it enables us to do More detailed higher resolution architectural drawings across more places, more frequently in the industry actually booms. And what we've seen historically is that when productivity goes up, costs go down. The actual volume balloons and the economy grows.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Historically, major empires have faced external conflicts and wars following periods of prosperity marked by debt bubbles, income inequality, wealth gaps, and excessive money printing. This cycle repeats itself every 500 years, leading to global conflicts. The correlation between economic factors like debt bubbles and the desire for conflict is evident in history.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think the statements are correct that Ukraine joining NATO escalates conflict. And we will find ourselves in a de facto global conflict, World War. Now, the question is, is that the cycle, the natural cycle? I will once again, Nick, pull it up, please. Reference Ray Dalio is typical big cycle behind Empire's rise in decline. As he spoke at length with us in person about at the All-In-Summit last year, he points out that the era of prosperity that over the last 500 years, we've seen six major empires go through Is followed by a debt bubble, which drives a wealth gap, which ultimately leads to economic challenges, which means printing more money, which is the cycle we are going through right Now with a, as you guys know, two to three trillion dollar annual deficit and explosion in federal debt levels. And that ultimately leads inevitably to external conflict to war. Now, the particular motivations in every case, in all six times this has happened in the last 500 years, look different when you read the history books about what were the circumstances That drove us to external conflict, that drove that nation to war. But the truth is, every single one of them was preceded by a debt bubble, income inequality, wealth gap, and the printing of money. And there's a relationship between those economic factors and a desire for conflict.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker questions the idea of extending NATO membership to countries like Ukraine due to the potential of being entangled in conflicts. They emphasize that countries do not have an inherent right to join NATO and highlight the importance of considering the interests of existing members in making such decisions. The speaker expresses reluctance towards sending troops to defend countries like Finland and Sweden, emphasizing the complexity of security commitments and the risks involved in extending Article 5 guarantees to additional nations.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>They're not part of NATO. And you know, this is the issue of our time. Are you saying send American soldiers?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Because that's what we're talking about. If France or Finland was in, would you be opposed to France? Well, if Russia invaded France, would you defend France?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Would you be in favor of the? Of course, that's our article five guarantee under NATO. This is why I don't want to extend an article five guarantee to Ukraine. Because it will put us directly in conflict with Russia. And I'm not interested in being in war three. Right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>And then so Finland and Sweden come up and I guess the argument would be, would you be in favor of sending troops to defend Finland and Sweden, the latest members of NATO and would you be In favor of that?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Now we're committed. And when you were in favor of them joining NATO, I guess is the next question. Should we discuss it on the pot? I explained that it was creating a liability not an asset, but what's done is done. Should free countries be able to join NATO, I guess, is at the end of the question. The question actually makes me make two points on that. The first one is countries don't have a right to join NATO. Any more than I have a right to join Augusta Country Club. Just because I'm a golf player doesn't mean I get to join Augusta. OK, it's up to the current membership of Augusta or NATO decide whether they're going to emit a country based on what is in their interests. It has never been in our interests to make Ukraine a security dependent of the United States. Sorry, this is the reality. The second thing I want to point out is that what was Russia demanding?</blockquote>

### [03:14] Improvement in Specific Domain Leads to Surprising Improvement in Other Domains

### ‚ú® Summary
Improving in a specific domain can lead to surprising enhancements in other domains, such as large models improving in coding which can enhance their general reasoning. This transfer of skills is similar to how the human brain learns through specialization in areas like chess or creative writing. While evidence of this transfer is limited, there is a hope for more examples to emerge, like the connection between coding, math, and reasoning. The mechanistic understanding of how skills transfer between different domains is yet to be fully grasped due to the lack of sophisticated analysis techniques.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, I think you first of all, I think you do actually sometimes get surprising improvement in other domains when you improve in a specific domain. So for example, when these large models sort of improve at coding, that can actually improve their general reasoning. So there is some evidence of some transfer, although I think we would like a lot more evidence of that. But also, that's how the human brain learns too, is if we experience and practice a lot of things like chess or writing, creative writing or whatever that is, we also tend to specialize And get better at that specific thing, even though we're using sort of general learning techniques and general learning systems in order to get good at that domain. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well, what's been the most surprising example of this kind of transfer for you? Like, you see language and code or images and text?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I think probably, I mean, I'm hoping we're going to see a lot more of this trying to transfer, but I think things like getting better at coding and math and generally improving your Reasoning.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>That is how it works with us as human learners. But I think it's interesting seeing that in these artificial systems. And can you see the sort of mechanistic way in which, let's say in the language and code example, there's like, I found the place in a neural network that's getting better with both the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Language and the code, or is it that too far down the weed?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, well, I don't think our analysis techniques are quite sophisticated enough to be able to hone in on that.</blockquote>

1. Defining 'good' as well-being in ethics allows for the translation of moral statements into purely descriptive terms, like avoiding suffering, collapsing the 'ought' into an 'is' statement.
2. One should remove judgmental language when discussing topics of right and wrong, good and evil, and focus on the actions people do rather than what they should do.

### ‚ú® Summary
Defining 'good' as well-being in ethics allows for the translation of moral statements into purely descriptive terms, like avoiding suffering. This approach collapses the 'ought' into an 'is' statement, creating a semantic world where moral statements can be analyzed based on their impact on well-being, allowing for investigations in ethics through a descriptive lens.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And I want to talk in a moment about how we go from that. I mean, if I put my hands on a stove, I'm going to want to take it away. It doesn't follow for me that if somebody else puts their hand on a stove, that I'm going to have that same feeling that they should take it away. Well, we'll get to that in a minute, perhaps. But yeah, sure, you know, if we know anything about well-being, we can, it seems, fatuous to say, you know, well, that's just your opinion, man. Who are you to, who are you to say anything? You know, you might as well be saying the same thing about physics. Sure. But the problem is that physics is a, is a purely descriptive enterprise, right? If you define things in particular ways, you can just sort of make sure everything's internally consistent, make sure that everyone knows how you're using your terms and, and all as Well. If you say that good just means something like well-being, if we just say that good is reducible to well-being, then I don't think you so much sort of cross the is or divide as just collapse The ought into an is statement. You've sort of created this, this semantic world in which you can say, whenever I say good, just imagine I'm saying something like avoiding suffering, something like that, I can translate Any moral statement now into purely descriptive terms. I can say, you know, it's, it's, it's not good for you to, or it's, it's bad for you to, to, to not allow women to vote. And I can just translate that in your terminology as it causes more overall suffering when women can't vote. Now, that can be true and false, you know, cool. Now we can do an, now we can do an investigation. Well, that's, that's like when we're talking about ethics anymore, in other words.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
One should remove judgmental language when discussing topics of right and wrong, good and evil. Expressing facts without judgment is similar to discussing arithmetic where two plus two equals four, without any subjective interpretation. It is important to focus on the actions people do rather than what they should do.

## Episode AI notes


1. Differentiating between unconscionable risk and intentional fraud is crucial when evaluating actions that may harm a company's well-being.
2. The collapse of FTX has caused harm to the Effective Altruism (EA) movement, with increased criticism and negative perceptions towards EA.
3. EA leaders emphasize that the ends do not justify the means, highlighting the importance of not acting as if calculations are infallible and adhering to statistics without violating side constraints.

### [44:00] Differentiating Between Unconscionable Risk and Intentional Fraud

### ‚ú® Summary
The distinction between knowing risks that are unconscionable and intentionally misappropriating funds for selfish purposes like buying luxury items is crucial. In this case, the individual questions if the actions were driven by a belief in colossal returns from investments, even if they were considered shady. The possibility that there was a perception of the funds returning securely to the company without harm to customers illustrates a lack of serious concern for the company's well-being.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So they knew what they were doing was wrong, could mean many things. It could mean that they knew that they were taking risks with people's funds that were unconscionable, you know, given the possibility of losing money that customers thought was safely On the exchange. But that's not the same thing as stealing money and misappropriating it in a way that is purely selfish, right? It's not like we took money that was not ours and we bought, you know, luxury condominiums and the Bahamas with it and hoped no one would notice, right? That's one style of fraud. This, you tell me, is it possible that they thought they were going to, you know, wager this money on other real investments, you know, however shady some of these crypto properties Are going to be. They actually expected enormous returns as a result of that misappropriation and that money would come back safely into FTX and no one would lose anything in the end if everything worked.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I mean, in terms of how things seem to me, I just think they didn't think the company was at risk, not a serious risk. And here's a couple of, there's a few reasons why.</blockquote>

### [55:43] Ends Do Not Justify the Means in EA Movement


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (54:24 - 55:44)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/99d18d3c-ac60-45c7-926f-8b00c9df4a8b)




### ‚ú® Summary
The collapse has caused significant harm to the EA movement, with about a 20% fear of its demise. The criticism and negative perceptions towards EA have increased. It is suggested that this collapse happened not because of EA but in spite of it. EA leaders have consistently maintained that the ends do not justify the means, which is a principle dating back to philosophers like John Stuart Mill. An essay titled 'The Ends Do Not Justify the Means Among Humans' emphasizes that even if one is a consequentialist, they should not act as if they are infallible in their calculations. Additionally, adhering to statistics and not violating side constraints is crucial.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, huge harm, huge harm to EA where, you know, at the time of the collapse, I put it like 20% or something that the EA movement would just die. This was a killer blow. Obviously, in terms of hit to the bland, you know, so many people think ill of EA now or critical of EA now and all sorts of different ways. Delivered by this in a way that's not surprising. It was this horrific, horrific thing. I don't think it happened because of EA. I think it happened in spite of EA. I think like EA leaders and communicators have been very consistent on the idea that the ends do not justify the means really since the start. And really, this goes back essentially. Go back to John Stuart Mill. And actually, even Sam knew this. So again, as part of just trying to figure out what happened, I did some Facebook archaeology. So there's an essay by Elieza Yucowski called the ends do not justify the means among humans. Basically making the classic point that you are not a god at calculation, even if you're 100% consequentialist, which I don't think you should be. So follow the statistics that are tried and true, including the statistics not to violate side constraints. And this was shared in a group, in a kind of discussion group.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast. This is Sam Harris. Okay, well, I wasn't going to have much of a housekeeping, but just before turning on the mic, I learned that Danny Kahneman has died. What a mensch he was. I didn't know him well. I really only hung out with him a few times. We did, I think, one blog interview a long time ago, in 2011 or so. That's on my website somewhere. And episode 150 of this podcast is audio from an event we did in New York at the Beacon Theatre, which I recall being a lot of fun. Danny was 90 today when he died, so that would have been about five years ago. He would have been 85. Just a beautiful mind and really good company. Again, I did not know him well. I have people close to me who were very close to him, and obviously I'm quite sorry for their loss. Life is short, even if you make it to 90. So let's use the time wisely. And that's what I did earlier this week</blockquote>

### [16:08] Emergent Complexity and Component Evolution

### ‚ú® Summary
Emergent complexity allows for simple components to interact and create complex systems. This complexity empowers the ability to upgrade and refine the basic components of the system without fundamentally changing their individual capabilities. For example, in a complex ant society or human brain, the emergent properties can enhance the capabilities of individual ants or neurons without altering their inherent simplicity or limited options.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That emerges up at the upper level. And it gives you abilities then to in effect reach down and change the component parts of your emergent system. And in effect, it's always relying on a model where once ants are having this amazingly complex society, once you have a brain that can do human brain sort of stuff, it can reach down and Make the ants smarter than they were and make the neurons smarter than they were. And the whole point of emergent complexity is you start off with some simple components that are stupidly simple, have very small number of rules for how they interact with the neighbors And out of that comes complexity. And the amazing thing about complexity is once that happens, those little ants, those single neurons are still just as simplistic and just as narrow in their options as they were beforehand. It's not the case that when ants form a whole emergently complex society that suddenly individual ants can speak French or something.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In complex systems like water molecules or the brain, emergent properties arise from the interactions of individual components. Wetness in water emerges from the interaction of water molecules sliding past each other. In the case of the brain, higher-level properties do not exert downward causation on lower-level constituents. Reductionism prevails as the behavior of the whole system is simply a story of what individual units are doing at the microscopic level.

#### üìö Transcript
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In the same way that you just said by your analogy to water, there is no wetness of a single molecule because the grosser property of wetness, the emergent property of a system of water Molecules is simply their disposition to slide freely past one another when water is in its liquid state. And if you only have one molecule, it's not sliding freely past anything because there's just one of it. But it is still true to say that in the case of water, what that water does is still entirely a story of what all those individual molecules do as causal agents in relation to one another At the microscopic level, right? So it's all the gross level phenomenon, even the emergent phenomenon that you can't conceptualize without reference to the whole. It is simply a story of what's happening at the bottom level. So the reductionism still runs through and there's no downward causation of a higher level property influencing the behavior of its lower level constituents. And in the case of a brain, there's nothing that emerges on the basis of neuronal complexity that then exerts its effects downward on to simpler constituents, whether it's neurons Or their behaviors in any way other than simply being more of a story of all of those individual units doing what those individual units are doing all the while.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Luck plays a significant role in shaping one's life as individuals have no control over the circumstances of their birth or the genetic and environmental factors that influence their abilities and talents. The concept of personal responsibility is questioned as individuals cannot claim credit for avoiding adverse conditions or for the genetic and environmental influences on their development. The idea of an immortal soul is also debunked as individuals do not have control over their innate qualities or the progress of their self. Ultimately, one's life is a result of the machine and its progression up to the present moment, challenging the perception of absolute free will.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Okay, so let's talk about the ethics and the role that luck plays here. Maybe what you and I are both sketching is, and sometimes the overwhelming significance of luck, right? You did not, you had absolutely no hand in in setting any of the causal conditions that the later got expressed in your personhood and in your life, right? As you just point out, like who on earth can imagine that they are responsible for the fact that they weren't born into some malarial swamp where they acquired from birth onward a host Of tropical diseases that made it impossible for them to flourish, right? No one, if you escape that, it is through no talent of your own, right? And every other talent that you built or acquired or discovered in yourself from that moment forward is something which your genes and your environment conspired to produce. And again, if you think there's an immortal soul integrated here made of some other stuff, let's call it ectoplasm, you didn't produce that either, right? You got exactly as much ectoplasm as you got and not a drop more. And from the earliest moments, this was the machine and its progress that became you and all the way up until this moment. And this is a moment in which you might feel, well, I'm free to do anything.</blockquote>

### [07:11] Open Country with a Growing Need


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (05:51 - 07:10)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a3302d78-9575-49fe-9834-007f71e9af58)




### ‚ú® Summary
The Canadian government has introduced a significant immigration program aiming to welcome half a million immigrants annually into a country with a population of 40 million. This approach is viewed as a conscious decision to address the need for labor and population growth in an open and growing nation, rather than an overwhelming experiment. The program includes pathways for both permanent and temporary immigrants, acknowledging the necessity of embracing immigration for the country's future development.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Basically, without the vineyards. Well, maybe a couple of British Columbia might disagree. So 40 million factor that into roughly just under 500,000, which are the levels that I announced a few weeks ago. So it is not an insignificant portion of the population.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>If there are 500 on a permanent path, how many are coming in on a temporary?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Numbers vary, but that could be upwards of a million, whether it's students, whether it's specialized temporary foreign workers. There is a pathway within there for people to become part of the eligible pool that we have for permanent residency.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I have to say, you sound not sanguine necessarily, but calm about this program. To me, the idea of taking in half a million immigrants a year in a country of only 40 million, that is just massive. So it strikes me that you all as a country have embarked on a massive immigration experiment. Does it feel massive to you? Or are you just responding to a market where you say, we need more immigrants for labor and population and so on?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think more of the latter than the former. There is no doubt that we have made a conscious decision to be an open country and a country that needs to grow. The reality is we don't have much of a choice.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You know, America's generally had a melting pot theory of immigration and Canada prides itself on the value of our differences and the diversity. There have been different drivers that have motivated people to move to Canada as opposed to moving to the United States. For example, during the Irish famine because there was attacks put on boats coming into near-Carber people went to Montreal. So there's all sorts of historical specificities that define us, whether you're talking about our history of being loyalists to the crown or others. There are similarities. There are differences, but largely both countries have been driven by fast waves of immigration.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>One big difference between Canada and the US is the politics around immigration. In the US, immigration has become extremely divisive. This is mostly because of the rise in illegal immigration, which has led to real chaos and that chaos is hard to address when the legal immigration system is also messy and complicated.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>In Canada, meanwhile, generally the consensus is quite positive. There is no major party that feels immigration is a bad thing, but I don't like lecturing other countries because I've never spent that much time in their shoes. Canada's southern border is the United States. The United States southern border is one where the migration flows are a lot more challenging than the ones you see.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So these are immigrants to the US who were on an H1B visa but didn't have a path toward permanent residency in the US. And then you actually call it a scoop program. I assume that means you're scooping them up from us. Yes, that's intentional.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, whoever wanted to come and apply it, we had a program to do that that we didn't have before in any obvious way.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This connects back to Bill Kerr from Harvard. Remember, he has a side hustle, the Canadian talent consulting agency called Mob Squad. They specialize in what is called near shoring.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>The majority of use cases for Mob Squad are where somebody has been working with the US company for two, three years, say in New York City. They have tried repeatedly to get an H1B and have failed every time. They are at that point that they're going to have to leave the country. We provide a way for them to be in Canada, set up permanent routes in Canada, buy a home, put their kids in school, and they can continue to work with the US firm that they were with before.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What are the characteristics that typically make Canada more viable for that kind of candidate?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Well, the first thing is proximity. If you were in a New York City high growth startup company and we move you to Toronto or Halifax, you're very close, same time zones.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>I was aware of Canada's merit-based system because a couple of people I knew had immigrated to Canada. One of them had immigrated because of job loss. In the US, on H1B, when you lose your job, you have 60 days to find a new job and apply for another H1B. It's called H1B Transfer. It's a misnomer. It's actually a fresh H1B. That was not possible for him. And he just left for Canada. So I was aware of the Canadian system. I did my research.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Canada doesn't issue visas by lottery, like the US does. And for permanent residents, they use a point-based system. Here's the economist Bill Kerr again, on which factors will get points for a given applicant.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>They range from level of education. You get a certain amount of points for having a bachelor's degree and then more for a master's degree or a doctorate. They can relate to being able to speak French.

## Episode AI notes


1. Embracing empathy and understanding in conflict is crucial for achieving peace by acknowledging motivations, empathizing with opposing sides, and breaking the cycle of violence.
2. College protests driven by youth activism require dialogue, embracing differing perspectives, and seeking meaningful attachments to issues for progress.
3. Youth activists often seek fulfillment and community through protests, similar to movements like Occupy Wall Street, due to a lack of prior strong convictions and experiences.
4. Progress towards peace and understanding can be achieved by listening to voices from all sides, fostering empathy, and creating paths for dialogue and cooperation.

### [30:40] Embracing Empathy for Understanding in Conflict


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (29:20 - 30:41)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/98a13521-e08a-4819-bf98-41ca40a9bfc0)




### ‚ú® Summary
In the midst of conflict and trauma, the key to peace lies in cultivating empathy and understanding for the pain and resistance of the other side. This requires acknowledging the motivations behind actions, empathizing with the desires and pain of the opposing side, and recognizing the cycle of violence that vengeance perpetuates. Breaking this cycle involves listening to voices from all sides, including those on campuses, in Palestine, and worldwide, in order to foster a path towards empathy and ultimately, peace.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Look at the three of you. You all don't cry a lot. This is traumatic because you all have mothers and daughters. You can feel what happens to a country. And that's why this was done. This was not an accident. This was on purpose. And unfortunately, it works.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Sexual violence.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think I think like for us to have a path towards peace, there has to be a degree despite the pain being felt a degree of empathy for the other side's desires, the other side's pain, the Other side's feeling that they were enacting a resistance against an oppression. How does one side embrace that aspect having gone through this? How do we get to a point that a people can say, I have empathy for the resistance after feeling this sort of pain? And this is the age old story of war. I for an eye. It never ends. It always goes on. What's the right path here to hear the other side, to hear the kids on campuses, to hear the people in Palestine, to hear the world saying, we feel free Palestine after going through this.</blockquote>

### [46:09] College Protests and Youth Activism


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (43:04 - 46:11)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f02d5f9-5ee9-4de0-8a3b-4e47dd6081f5)




### ‚ú® Summary
College protests are driven by a deep sense of conviction among students who feel the need to take strong actions, like setting up encampments, to move the needle on important issues. However, progress is hindered by the lack of dialogue, inability to embrace differing perspectives, and the presence of hardened views on all sides. This phenomenon is particularly observed in elite institutions where privileged youth seek fulfillment and a sense of attachment by engaging in protests. The behavior of youth activists can be likened to the Occupy Wall Street movement, where young people found community and intimacy around shared grievances. The drive for strong convictions and attachment stems from a lack of prior experiences in feeling strongly about anything, leading to negative actions filling the void. The key to progress lies in fostering dialogue, embracing differing perspectives, and seeking meaningful attachments to issues that truly resonate with individuals.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>These colleges have rules. Some of the colleges, most colleges have a rule that you can't protest in the president's office. There are colleges where the faculty and administration, when people are protesting in the president's office, they're serving them food. There are colleges that say, you're not allowed to protest here. Go outside.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But if you feel if you feel deep down in your heart that it's a matter of life or death, don't you feel justified that having an encampment setting up a tent living there showing that that Degree of conviction is necessary because you're saving lives versus, hey, I think something is a good idea. Let me go protest for an hour during lunch and then I'll leave. It's never going to move the needle. The question I'm asking as a young person is how do I move the needle? And there's not a lot of ways that people feel empowered to move the needle. So it seems rational to me to some degree that they want to go into these encampments and they want to do something strong and show their conviction. But again, I think that there's a question on how much truth is anyone willing to see how much are folks willing to embrace the other side? How much are they willing to listen? I see very little listening, very little dialogue going on because then you put up a list of demands that are unmetable. And you deny anyone to have a conversation and you deny listening to the other side and you take this hardened view that doesn't allow for progress. And I think it's the hardened views on all sides that's limiting progress entirely. Unfortunately, the youth have been subsumed by this. And it's really frustrating to see because I worry about what that leads to. I think it's not necessarily the use, meaning I think you're seeing it in some very specific places that cater to a very specific kind of youth. You see them at Columbia, Harvard, there are these specific Berkeley UCLA that are bastions of privileged kids for the most part. These are extremely elite institutions that typically allow in kids that have been coached their entire lives to get into those schools. And I think that they're coming there with a lack of fulfillment. And it reminds me at some level of how people reacted to Occupy Wall Street, meaning there were a whole bunch of young people there that probably didn't even know what the whole Occupy Wall Street movement was about.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>They showed them South Tremoth, it was a platform for whatever your grievance was. That was their state admission.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And I think what they found a decade and a half ago or so was community in this weird way. The physical interaction of other people where you had this intimacy around a thing. I'm not condoning Occupy Wall Street, just like I'm not condoning what's happening on campuses. But I think psychologically, what kids are looking for is that level of attachment. And to your point, David, something that they can feel strongly about. And I think they end up getting to the age of 18 and 19, not having felt strongly about anything, because they were working on playing nine sports and 14 instruments and all this other Bullshit to go to these schools. And then they get there and they feel a little empty.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And sometimes negative things can fill the void. What I was going to say is I think the answer lies in what you're in what we're saying. David, you started out by saying, how are we going to get to progress?</blockquote>

### [17:52] Strategic Tactics for Rapid Growth in a Competitive Space

### ‚ú® Summary
Achieving rapid growth from zero to one million ARR in a highly competitive industry involves strategic tactics like attracting strategic investors with newsletters and media experience, leveraging early relationships and investors, and building transparency through sharing numbers and metrics, allowing for quick response to user feedback.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There's a lot there. I feel like I can kind of do like a masterclass of like everything going on in my head in terms of how I was. I mean, I feel like any company that starts thinking go from zero to one million ARR in a very competitive space has dozens of growth tactics and things that they did very intentionally To help reach that milestone because the zero to one is by far the hardest part, especially in a hyper competitive industry like email in general. So it took us 14 months to go from zero to a million ARR. And there's probably dozens of things I could attribute that to, but a few that jump out is one, our very first seed round, which actually Scott is an investor in. We strategically had a long tail of strategic investors who have newsletters who have media experience in the hopes that being our early adopters, kind of incentivizing them to move Their newsletter over. Again, when you launch like your product is the worst it will ever be day one. And when there's much more mature platforms in market, you kind of need like an extra incentive to win over those early adopters. And so leaning on early relationships and investors is like one kind of like growth hack to get that initial cohort in the door. So that helped. Two is, I would say, building in public has been very powerful for us. I know it's cliche and a lot of people do it. Some people are like totally against sharing numbers and metrics. I'm the opposite. Everything is an open book. I share cost. I share revenue. I share growth. I share the upsides, the downsides because one, I think people can align with a person and a story more than like a business and a brand. Yeah. And so I never intended to really be the face of the brand, but in being able to share and promote other newsletters, you're having success on the platform and also being very quick to Respond to user feedback and how we can make it better.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Choosing a software vendor based on the trajectory of their product and the relationship you have with them can be a significant selling point. Having a direct line to provide feedback and seeing tangible improvements based on that feedback can be viewed as a competitive advantage. Sharing milestones and successes can lead to warm leads, introductions to potential investors or customers, and overall increase opportunities for growth and success.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I actually think if you were deciding between a different software vendor and you're kind of like up in the air between two or three, being able to bet on trajectory and a person that you Think actually has your best interest in heart and is trying much harder to make this work and succeed and that you have their ear directly to provide feedback, I actually think is a pretty Key selling point. Whether it's the most scalable selling point is TBD, but I'm sure that there's plenty of people that I've DM with over the days that view it as a competitive advantage to be able to say, Here's three things I think you can do better. And I have the track record of listening to them and delivering on those three things pretty quickly. And then lastly, when you hit milestones, it opens up a lot of doors. I don't have to share on Twitter and LinkedIn that we hit 3 million ARR, 4 million ARR, 5 million ARR. But when I do, I get dozens of warm leads from people who are like, hey, I've been following the journey. I think I'm moving off platform X to jump over to you or, hey, can I make an introduction to this investor, this advertiser, this newsletter, because I think they'd be a perfect fit. And I think it's just like maximizing your luck surface area. The more you can share, the more hype that you can build around the narrative that you're building on, the more opportunities and doors that open of people who either align with you and Want to help you succeed, or at least just with the algorithms and everything else, being able to surface your success as a broader opportunity to whether it's investment is what you're Going for or new customers. It helps just expand the opportunities there.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Do you think that you had your your why that you find your why? Have you found it?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I mean, I also think there's a level of like, it's, I complain all the time about how stressed I am and how there's so much to do and not enough time in the day. But at the end of the day, it's really fun. Like I'm solving problems. I'm working with really talented smart people that I like to work with. And we are the underdogs in a very competitive industry and we're doing really well. And it is like a fun thing to do. And I think just fundamentally taking a step back and like you work for what 50, 60, 70% of like you're waking hours, you might as well do something you care about and that's fun and enjoyable And challenging. And every day is a challenge. So on a personal level, the why is like continuing to learn continuing to build and do something that I care about. I am also extremely competitive. And so I take notes of everyone who said no to us on the investing side, all the competitors who think that they can run over us. Like the list goes on of like different small things that motivate me, but being extremely competitive and wanting to build something that I think can be as synonymous as like a Mailchimp Or a Google at one point is like something that I'm trying to build. And it's a big audacious goal. And that's what makes it fun is kind of putting your head down and trying to build it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Well, and with Desperage is what is what's been the best moment in this journey?

## Episode AI notes


1. The national conversation about immigrants often focuses on incorrect narratives, such as the villain and victim narratives, which fail to highlight the economic and social benefits immigrants bring to society.
2. Immigrants have a net positive impact on the economy, with the children of immigrants climbing the economic ladder faster, many Fortune 500 companies founded by immigrants, and immigrants contributing significantly to US patents and entrepreneurship.
3. Protectionist policies can lead to economic decline, as seen in the case of Argentina, and immigrants in the second and third generations contribute significantly more than the cost of their immigration, resulting in a net gain for states.
4. Studies show a negative impact of immigration on the wages of existing residents, particularly among the lowest education bracket, due to increased labor supply.
5. Immigrants and native workers often bring different skill sets and play distinct roles in the job market, which can create opportunities for both groups to fill different types of roles.
6. The US immigration system faces challenges in attracting and retaining top talent, with a system more focused on family-based visas rather than employment-based visas.
7. Becoming knowledgeable about immigration policies can be essential for individuals living in the US due to the complexities and limitations of the immigration system.

### [21:55] Immigrant Narratives: Villain vs Victim


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (20:32 - 22:29)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44ecec27-ebc6-4f26-a98b-f3365ca205d4)




### ‚ú® Summary
The national conversation about immigrants is often framed around incorrect narratives: the villain narrative, which portrays immigrants as threats to jobs, national security, and the rule of law; and the victim narrative, which views immigration as beneficial only to immigrants. These narratives fail to highlight the economic and social benefits immigrants bring to the society. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that immigrants have a net positive impact on the economy, with the children of immigrants climbing the economic ladder faster, many Fortune 500 companies founded by immigrants or their children, immigrants contributing significantly to US patents, and being more likely to start their own businesses compared to the native-born population.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Zeke Hernandez again.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>A lot of our national conversation about immigrants is framed around two narratives that both are incorrect and they do a lot of damage to us.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Hernandez himself is an immigrant from Uruguay. He came here for college and stayed.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I call one of them the villain narrative, which is the idea that immigrants hurt us because they steal our jobs. They threaten our national security. They threaten the rule of law. The evidence contradicts that. But then interestingly, on the pro-immigrant side, the most common narrative is what I call the victim narrative, which is the idea that immigration is good for immigrants. We owe the poor huddled masses of MLasar as his poem, Compassion, even if it costs us. That's a very moral point of view, but it's a weak argument because it doesn't tell everyone else what immigrants do for the rest of us. The anti-immigrant messages focus on how immigrants affect us. The pro-immigrant messages focus on how immigration affects immigrants. And there isn't this narrative of the truth about how immigrants affect us economically and socially. I thought, boy, we're giving up so much because the evidence so overwhelmingly shows net positive benefits for us, not for immigrants. I mean, yes, for immigrants too, but like for us.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We heard a lot of that evidence in the first episode of this series. For instance, the children of immigrants climb the economic ladder at a higher rate than the children of parents who were born in the US. Nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or their children.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Immigrants today are responsible for 36% of all patents in the US. They tend to be mostly Asian immigrants, but not exclusively. And so had the US not allowed those immigrants in, we wouldn't have those patents.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And immigrants are 80% more likely than the native born to start their own business.</blockquote>

### [24:47] Economic Decline Due to Protectionist Policies


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (23:23 - 24:47)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/634dfeda-0efd-4aeb-8002-df436da6a659)




### ‚ú® Summary
History shows that countries, like Argentina, can experience economic decline due to protectionist policies that limit foreign investment and ideas. This decline was exemplified by Argentina's shift in the early 1900s under Juan Per√≥n, resulting in reduced immigrant influx and economic stagnation. Although the US followed a similar path at one point, its less dysfunctional political landscape may have prevented a decline as severe as Argentina's.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I don't think so, but I think it would be on its way to decline. In fact, I think a good historical parallel to the US, which even follows a lot of the same timeline, is Argentina. So in 1900, immigrants were equally likely to go to both places. So Italians would go as much to Buenos Aires as they would to New York because Argentina produced cars. Argentina had a thriving manufacturing industry. It was a country with a lot of very talented, educated people. Then the two countries diverged. A populist movement led by Juan Per√≥n. Those are the people who know the musical. Evita's husband, Juan Per√≥n, started a bunch of policies that were deeply protectionist and exclusionary. So Argentina stopped receiving as many immigrants. It turned inside economically. It started preventing foreign investment and ideas from coming in. I don't want to oversimplify. There's a lot of other differences between the US and Argentina since then. But Argentina has not fared well and kind of entered this consistent little by little economic decline to the point of being what it is today. And I think the US would have probably been similar, perhaps not as bad as what Argentina is because it politics were less dysfunctional, at least back then. But I think it's a good parallel.</blockquote>

### [31:28] Long-term Benefits of Immigration and the Lack of Reimbursement


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (30:17 - 31:25)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3af08627-4c7b-4892-bf6a-db81d9e1f4f7)




### ‚ú® Summary
Immigrants in the second and third generations contribute significantly more than the cost of their immigration, resulting in a net gain of $254 billion across all states. The federal government benefits greatly from immigrants, with each immigrant providing a net tax benefit of around $260,000, totalling over $10 trillion in taxes collected over the years. However, states bear the costs of welcoming new immigrants without reimbursement, highlighting the disparity between federal benefits and state costs.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>If you look in the long run, however, at the state level, those children that were expensive to immigrate, so that's now the second generation, contribute positively to the tune of $1,700 per immigrant and the grandchildren, the third generation, to the tune of 1,300 per immigrant. So if you added up over three generations, the gain for the second and third generation is $254 billion across all states versus a cost of $57 billion. So it's a positive return on investment, but it just takes a long time. And so I think the legitimate conversation is why is the federal government not reimbursing states for the costs that they bear to welcome new immigrants? The estimates show that the net benefit at the federal level, the net tax benefit of each immigrant is like $260,000. That adds up to over $10 trillion in taxes collected over many decades because of immigrants, but it's just that the federal government gets the benefits, states bear those costs unevenly, And there's no reimbursement scheme.</blockquote>

### [34:42] Negative impact of immigration on wages


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (32:47 - 34:46)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7780860f-1819-4f4b-a9fd-66c93fb684ca)




### ‚ú® Summary
Studies consistently show a negative impact of immigration on the wages of existing residents due to increased supply of labor. Research after the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and studies on teenagers and mathematicians all point to lower wages in regions with more immigrants. Though some argue for complex factors offsetting this effect, the data highlights a significant impact on wages, particularly among the lowest education bracket in the US. A debate exists on the accuracy of the report's summary, with skeptics like George Borhaus claiming bias in downplaying the negative wage impact of immigration.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>They created a table that reviewed all of the relevant studies to look at what the effect of immigration was on the wages of people already here. And it is dominated by negative numbers. The economic logic here is fairly straightforward when the supply of a good increases, all else equal, the price of that good tends to fall. And so when you look at individual studies, the aftermath of the 1994 Mexican peso crisis, which led to this burst of immigration here, it found that wages fared worse in regions of the US that had more people who were coming here because of the peso crisis. Another study has looked at teenagers and found that those who live in place with less immigration tend to work more and earn more. A particularly elegant, if narrow study looked at mathematicians and found that American born mathematicians fared really poorly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and all these Eastern European and Soviet mathematicians came into the country. It's a very basic concept, but a lot of advocates for immigration tend to dismiss it and say, no, no, there are all these other complex factors that erase that effect. And they can diminish that effect, but they don't erase it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Although I do see one line in the summary of the study, which is the impact of immigration on the overall native wage may be small and close to zero. And the bulk of the effect is among the lowest education bracket in the US. So tell me why you think that statement that the impact is small close to zero doesn't line up with your assessment.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>There's a whole fascinating debate about the summary written about that report. One member of that expert panel, George Boorhaus, who tends to be more skeptical of immigration, released a separate summary, arguing that the summary did not fully accurately describe The report's own evidence and that it put a thumb on the scale.</blockquote>

### [38:24] Diverse skill sets and roles in the job market

### ‚ú® Summary
Immigrants and native workers often bring different skill sets and play distinct roles in the job market. Immigrants may take on tasks that do not require language skills, creating opportunities for natives to move into roles that demand English proficiency. This reallocation results in occupations that do not directly compete with each other. The complexity of immigration involves various inputs, outputs, conflicts between humanitarian and economic interests, and the tendency for individuals to cherry-pick facts for arguments.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>The other is that even for jobs in which both immigrants and natives want to work, they bring different skill sets and play different roles or have different occupations. Let's say you have an immigrant in the construction field, that immigrant might not speak English very well. So that immigrant will end up doing the drywall work or the work that doesn't require language skills. And that will create a push for the native construction worker perhaps to become the foreman where he or she needs to speak English. And so you also get this reallocation into occupations that don't compete directly with each other.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>By now, you may be starting to feel about immigration the way I do. The more you dig in, the more you can appreciate just how complicated it is, how many inputs there are and how many outputs, how many conflicts between a humanitarian impulse and an economic One, how many arguments we have with family and friends and political rivals that aren't based on evidence, in part because the evidence itself is complicated and in part because we Humans like to cherry pick the facts in order to win our arguments.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I'll say something provocative and I don't know if this is true, but I wonder if this is one case</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Having 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US doesn't signify 11 million bad apples but rather highlights flaws in the immigration system. Outdated visa numbers since 1990 and 1965 lead to a mismatch between economic needs and talent supply. Small and medium businesses struggle to find talent due to complexities and costs of the immigration system. There's a significant disparity between America's demand for skilled workers and the immigration system's limitations. Immigrants are prominent in STEM fields, prompting questions about the quality of STEM education in the US compared to other countries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>When you have 11 million people in that status, it's too simplistic to say that it's 11 million bad apples. It's that our system of bringing apples into the US is totally messed up. When you haven't updated the number of visas since 1990, and in some cases since 1965, you just have a huge mismatch between the economic needs of businesses and the supply of talent That those businesses need. A lot of people think, oh, it's big, greedy corporations that are hiring these undocumented immigrants. The truth is or not, it's the small and medium businesses that dot your community who have a very hard time finding talent, who don't have the resources to pay for expensive immigration Lawyers or navigate the complicated US immigration system. There's just a huge mismatch between America's demand for people and the supply that the system allows. What does it take to start Zoom or Google or open AI? It takes really deep STEM skills and immigrants are just overrepresented in STEM fields. They're nearly half of the STEM workforce with graduate degrees.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Is that more reflection on excellent STEM education in those places or crappy STEM education in this country?</blockquote>

### [52:22] Talent Attraction and Retention in the US

### ‚ú® Summary
Only 14% of green cards are given for employment purposes while two-thirds are for family purposes, indicating a system not fully designed to attract the world's best talent. The US benefits from talent due to being a preferred destination and having top-tier higher education institutions that attract international students. Despite this, the US struggles to retain international talent, as evidenced by the limited H1B visa slots compared to the high number of applicants, leading to a significant loss of skilled immigrants.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Only 14% of green cards annually are given for employment base purposes and two thirds are given for family base purposes. So we have a system that actually isn't designed to benefit from the world's best and brightest. Mostly, the US gets so much talent because the US is still the preferred destination for talented people. I would also say the other thing that the US is still outstanding at is higher education. The US has the highest quantity and on average the highest quality of education institutions. And they are the preferred institutions for most international students. Even though the US only keeps less than a quarter of them in the labor force, the US is still getting a lot of that supply of really talented people through education. We just do a really bad job of keeping them.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Just how bad a job does the US do in keeping talented immigrants? Consider the H1B visa program that Hernandez mentioned. It is a three year work visa for a variety of specialized occupations. There are 85,000 slots every year.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>That number is fixed. This time, I believe it was somewhere around 700,000 applicants.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That is Sindhu Mahadevan.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I work in quality assurance in the medical device industry.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker talks about their experience of becoming knowledgeable about immigration due to living in the US and having to understand visa rules. They attribute their familiarity with immigration policies to their regulated industry job and the necessity to stop working, which led them to question the benefits of the system.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Did the notification that you needed to stop working come from the US government? Did it come from your employer? What happened there?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>No, the funny thing is if you live in the US, you become very familiar with immigration. You just get to know this stuff because you have to know the rules of your visa status. You have to know what happens when it ends. You kind of have to figure out how to swim.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I understand that you became a sort of immigration nerd, yes? Yes. That you got to know the policies and regulations inside now. Was that on purpose? Or was that just the process of you learning a lot about the system because of your personal involvement?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 4</b><br/><br/>I think it was a combination of things. Number one, I work in a regulated industry. So reading a lot of dense material comes kind of naturally to me, I guess. The second thing is I had to stop working. And that led me down a path where I was wondering who does this benefit?</blockquote>

### [16:42] Articulate the Perspective of Others


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (15:25 - 18:52)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a706cfd-8c9f-4dd9-ac73-a0880c9fdc1a)




### ‚ú® Summary
Empathy is the ability to understand and articulate the perspective of others without necessarily agreeing or liking them. It requires straight understanding of where they're coming from, without the need for agreement. Empathy can be a powerful tool as it allows you to connect with and understand anyone, even if you do not sympathize or agree with them. It is important to show that you understand someone's perspective, regardless of your own views, in order to have a meaningful conversation and potentially bridge gaps of understanding.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric. The people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people. We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly. And I would say to them, you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that are anti-Islamic and they shake their head and go, yeah. And that'd be the start of the conversation. That's empathy. You believe this to be the case. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed. But I showed them that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs. I was so unafraid of them that I was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because I would say that and then I'd shut up and let them react. And I never had to say, here's why you're wrong. I never gave my point of view. Every single one of them are testified. That's empathy, not agreeing where the other side is coming from.</blockquote>

### [34:49] The potential Danger in Future in AI 


[üéß Play snip - 6minÔ∏è (28:37 - 34:49)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59b9fb7e-d865-4ff5-83d7-270e600401ad)




### ‚ú® Summary
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to replace human experts in various fields such as software design and theorem proving. As AI technology advances, high-status jobs like radiologists could be among the first to be replaced by AI. The focus will be on performance, and humans may become negligent if they do not utilize AI advancements to reduce risks, such as in autonomous driving. While making people smarter through AI assistance seems beneficial, current technology cannot replicate the free will and decision-making capabilities of humans. In the short term, the focus will be on making existing jobs more efficient. However, there are challenges in understanding and explaining AI algorithms, their brittleness, and vulnerability to attacks, which need to be addressed. In addition to economic impacts, national security, and job displacement, the dangers of misinformation, manipulation, and the creation of harmful tools and viruses by malicious actors need to be considered. It is necessary to have discussions about regulating AI use in social media to ensure the authenticity of human-generated content and limit the influence of AI-powered systems.

And all of a sudden, the need for human developers at all, or human mathematicians at all, or just make the list as long as you want. It seems like some of the the highest status jobs cognitively might be among the first to fall. Which is to say, i certainly expect, at this point, to have an a i radiologist, certainly before i have an a i plumber. And there's a lot more above and beyond the radiology side of that comparison that i think its going to fall before ine. Basic manual tasks fall to robots. And this, this is a picture of real success, right? Because in the end, all we're going to care about is performance. We're not going to care about keeping a a monkey in the loop just for reasons of sentimentality. You know, you're telling me that my car can drive a thousand times better than i can, which is to say that, you ow, is going to reduce my risk of getting in a fatal accident, ando killing Myself or killing someone else, by a factor of a thousand, if i just flip on autopilot. Well, then, not only am i going to flip it on, i'm going to consider anyone who declines to do that to be negligent to the point of criminality. And that's never going to change. Everything. Is going to be in the position of a current chess master who knows that the best player on earth is never going to be a person ever an, right? Because because of alpha zero. So, so i take tat warv.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I disagree a little bit, and i'll tell you why i think you're correct in about 30 years. But i don't think that argument is true in the short term.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Andyi know i was not. Itrest to beclare. I'm not suggesting any time frame there. I'm just saying, ultimately, if we continue to make progress, something like this seems bound to happen.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But what i want to say is, i defy you to argue with me that making people smarter is a bad thing. So let's start with the premise of the human assistant. That is, e the thing that you're using will make humans smarter. It'll make it deeper, better analysis, better choices. But at least the current technology cannot replace the, essentially the free will of humans. They sort of wake up in the morning, you have a new idea, you decide something. You say, that's a bad idea, so fart and so on. We don't know how to do that yet. And and i've some speculation on how that will happen. But in the next decade, we're going to not be solving that problem. Weoud be solving a different problem, which is, how do we get the existing people doing existing jobs to do them more efficiently, that is, smarter, better, faster? One of the when we looked at the funding for this, a i programm that i've since announced, the funding the hundred 25 million, a fair chunk of it is going to really hard computer science Problems. Some of them include, we don't really understand how to explain what they're doing. As i mentioned, they 're all so brittle. They fail. They can fail catastrophically, like, why did it fail? And no one can explaino theyare hardening. There are resistance to attack problems. There are a number of problems of this kind. These are hard computer science problems, which i think we will get through. They use a lot of power. The algorithms are expensive, that sort of thing. But we have also focusing around the impact on jobs and employment in economics. Weare also focus on national security. And we're focusing on the question that you're asking, which is, what's our identity? What does it mean to be human? Before general intelligence comes, we have to deal with the fact that these systems are not capable of choosing their own outcome, but they can be applied to you as a citizen, by somebody Else, against your own satisfaction. So the ne es before a g i are all of the form misinformation, misleading information, creating dangerous tools. And for example, dangerous viruses. For the same reason that we built aa, fantastic new andebiotic drug, it looks like. You could also imagine a similar evil team of producing an incredible number of bad viruses, you know, things it would hurt people. And you could imagine, in that scenario, they might be clever enough to be able to hurt a particular race or particular sex, or something like that, which would be totally evil and obviously A very bad thing. We don't have a way of discussing that to day. So when i look at the positives and negatives right now, i think the positives, as with many technologies, really overwhelm the negatives. But the negatives need to be looked at. And we need to have the conversation right now about fruitless use social media, which is an easy whipping boy. Here i would like so i'm clear what my political position is. I am a very strong proponent of freedom of speech for humans. I am not in favor of freedom f speech for computers, robots, bots, silver and so on. I want an option with social media which says, i only want to see things that a human has actually communicated from themselves. I want to know that it wasn't snuck in by some russian agent. I want proof of providence, and i want to know that it's a human. And if it's a real human who's, in fact, you know, agent or crazier, whatever, i want be able to hear their voice, and i want to be able to decide i don't agree with it. What's happening instead is these systems are being boosted, they're being pitched, they're being sold by a i. And i think that's got to be limited in some way. I'm in favor of free speech, but i don't want, i don't want only some people to have megaphones.</blockquote>

### [03:54] Interpreting Quantum Theory


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (02:14 - 03:53)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/43a854f9-5058-4ebc-bc92-d0f40c4fee23)




### ‚ú® Summary
A small proportion of theoretical physicists engage in interpreting quantum theory, especially in branches where understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial. This interpretation is sometimes dismissed as just an 'excuse' by likening it to creationists calling evolution an interpretation of fossils. The speaker emphasizes the tight logical connection between evidence and its interpretation in both contexts.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Are perhaps 10% of theoretical physicists, but the proportion is much higher in certain branches of physics, where you have to actually ask what is happening to bring about the predictions That quantum theory makes, rather than just using the predictions as a sort of almanac. And philosophically, I think that, and yes, so one of the excuses that's commonly made is to call this an interpretation of quantum theory, rather than calling it quantum theory. That's a kind of a trick. It's a bit like creationists calling the theory of evolution an interpretation of fossils, because after all, no one's ever seen a dinosaur, no one's ever seen other universes, no One's ever seen... These are actually stone, which is just evidence of dinosaurs, not actual dinosaurs. And similarly, interference phenomenon are just evidence of other universes. They are not themselves other universes. So the logical connection between these things is very tight. It's the same level of excuses being made.</blockquote>

### [15:28] Parallel Universes Indicated by Photon Behavior


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (14:04 - 15:28)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2ab8bd01-7766-45a5-9627-dd0d01778a30)




### ‚ú® Summary
The behavior of photons passing through slits on a screen indicates the existence of parallel universes. Photons arriving at specific points on the screen stop arriving when a second slit is opened, suggesting they 'know' that there are now two slits instead of one. The mathematics behind this phenomenon shows that the number of slits open determines where the photons arrive, with each number of slits giving a different pattern. These results suggest that the behavior of a single photon passing through a slit changes when another slit is opened, leading to the possibility of parallel universes.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Now the thing that tells us conclusively that there are parallel universes, wait for it, is that there are certain points on the screen where photons, let's say you have one slit open, Where photons are arriving, and if you open the second slit, they stop arriving there. So how come? Well, obviously they must stop arriving because they know that there are two slits open now and not just one. And if you look at the mathematics of this, what determines whether they arrive or not depends on whether how many slits are open. There's a one, two, five, seventeen, they all give a different pattern. And the mathematics tells us when opening a new slit will stop arriving at a given point.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So to be clear, we're still talking about firing one photon through the same slit as before. It's just that because we've opened up another slit now, suddenly that photon just isn't going through that slit in the same way as it was before.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So then we can do various kinds of experiments.</blockquote>

### [01:17:14] Seeking Truth and Decisiveness for High Velocity


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:16:10 - 01:17:17)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c8ade9d-fa04-4212-867c-d288525f907b)




### ‚ú® Summary
Achieving high system velocity involves seeking truth and making decisive decisions efficiently. Exhausting the other person or compromising does not lead to truth-seeking. In cases where the real truth is elusive, disagreeing and committing can be useful. Escalation to a higher authority for decision-making is preferred over a war of attrition. Decisiveness and moving forward swiftly on decisions contribute significantly to increasing velocity. Delayed decision-making is a common factor that impedes progress at all scales and fostering a culture of rapid decision-making is essential for achieving high velocity.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Do you want to get to the resolution as quickly as possible? Because that ultimately leads to a high velocity of the system.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes. And you want to try to get as close to truth as possible. So you want like exhausting the other person is not truth seeking. And compromise is not truth seeking. So it doesn't mean, now there are a lot of cases where no one knows the real truth. And that's where disagreeing and commit can come in. But escalation is better than war of attrition. Escalate to your boss and say, hey, we can't agree on this. We like each other. We're respectful of each other. But we strongly disagree with each other. We need you to make a decision here so we can move forward. But decisiveness, moving forward quickly on decisions, as quickly as you responsibly can, is how you increase velocity. Most of what slows things down is taking too long to make decisions at all scale levels. So it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity. Amazon has a million and a half people. And the company is still fast.</blockquote>
