<context> I am an enthusiastic podcast listener and frequently use Snipd, a podcast snipping app that lets me generate AI-powered notes whenever I encounter insightful or interesting moments. Recently, I exported all my snips into a large markdown file, totaling 1.7 MB. </context> 

<task> I want to analyze my podcast consumption habits through a comprehensive data science analysis of this dataset. Here’s what I’d like to explore:
Metadata Analysis:

Create a time series to visualize when I listened to podcasts.
Analyze the number of episodes I’ve listened to from each podcast, both overall and over time.
Determine the number of snips I’ve created per show, identify the most snipped podcast or episode, and examine snip lengths.
Content Analysis:

Extract key keywords and frequently appearing topics, and visualize them effectively.
Generate a topography map to show how often certain keywords appear near each other (keyword similarity).
Explore how the content might shape my political views using the 4-quadrant model, where snips with political content are classified along axes like left/right and libertarian/authoritarian. This might require utilizing LLMs for text analysis.
Please suggest additional analyses or interesting insights that could be derived from this dataset, based on the markdown file described.

Additionally, here’s an initial thought process:

Data Parsing:

Extract metadata (e.g., podcast title, show name, episode date) and snip content from the markdown file, storing it in a structured format like a Pandas DataFrame.
Metadata Insights:

Conduct time-series analysis for listening patterns, snip frequency by show, snip length distributions, and identify active listening periods (e.g., by time of day).
Content Insights:

Use keyword extraction, topic modeling (e.g., LDA, BERTopic), and clustering (e.g., k-means, UMAP) to uncover themes and relationships.
Apply sentiment analysis or emotion classifiers to evaluate tone trends over time.
Political Influence:

Use LLMs or classifiers to map snips with political content onto a 2D political compass and analyze how my listening habits align with different political perspectives.
Additional Ideas:

Build co-occurrence networks of frequently mentioned keywords to reveal thematic clusters.
Correlate listening duration (if available) with snip frequency to identify patterns in how I engage with content.
Please refine or expand on this plan as needed!
