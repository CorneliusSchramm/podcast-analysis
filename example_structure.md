## Episode AI notes


1. AI reflects the flaws of existing healthcare systems, with its effectiveness directly tied to the human-written rules it automates, highlighting the need for systemic improvements.
2. Denial rates in healthcare are influenced by the speed of AI executing flawed processes, rather than the technology itself, emphasizing the importance of redesigning business models.
3. To improve healthcare workflows for professionals, new tools must be integrated seamlessly into existing systems like electronic health records to enhance adoption and reduce burden.
4. Startups should focus on creating AI-driven products that resonate with healthcare providers, taking into account their insights and the industry's demands to encourage widespread use.
5. AI has considerable potential in enhancing clinical trials, where even small improvements can lead to significant financial benefits, drawing parallels to optimization successes in advertising.
6. There is a unique opportunity to design AI-native health plans that rethink payment mechanisms and risk underwriting, aiming for personalization rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

### ‚ú® Summary
In a value-based care world, AI serves as a catalyst for improvement, yet its effectiveness directly depends on the existing human-written rules it automates. Current complaints regarding increased denial rates stem from the speed of AI in executing flawed rules, not from the technology itself. The root issue lies within the human-designed processes, and a shift to new business models provides an opportunity to address and rectify these systemic flaws, promoting more logical spend control.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It's fun to think that in a fee-for world, AI is nice, but maybe actually goes against what you want. In a value-based care world, actually AI is the catalyst. If you can do things better, you can see the value.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's actually funny, the example that that reminds me of is how the AI are getting sued right now. There's a bunch of major national payers who are using AI algorithms to automate prior authorization. And so all they're doing is taking the rules that humans wrote, that humans were executing slowly, and doing it faster. And so now all of a sudden, everyone is complaining, oh, everything, like the denial rate is going up, but it's actually not the rate of denial is not going up, it's the speed with which The denials are happening that's going up. Don't blame the technology, the humans who actually wrote the rules and you're just seeing kind of an exacerbated version of it. We're going to deal with a lot of that of kind of the finger pointing at the technology where it's actually just implementing the broken system underneath it. And that's why this kind of move to like new business models gives you the opportunity to clean that up and start with logical ways to control spend.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To enhance the workflow for healthcare professionals, especially doctors, new tools must be designed to be perceived as beneficial rather than burdensome. This can be achieved by integrating solutions directly into existing systems like electronic health records (EHR), eliminating the need for individual physician buy-in. Startups should focus on creating products that are eagerly adopted by healthcare providers, tapping into their understanding of the industry and user needs. Additionally, there is significant potential for AI-driven innovations in clinical trials. By improving the efficiency of clinical trials, which are crucial in healthcare and highly funded, even a modest enhancement in their performance can yield substantial returns, making this sector ripe for development.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think so. The whole problem with co-pilots is, can you work it in a way that goes in the doctor workflow where they view it as a benefit, not a nuisance. It's not some alert or whatever. It's like something where they are going to it. If you can do that, and maybe we've seen this with scribes and so on, something where doctors are like, hell yeah, I want this. This is great. If we can create that, and maybe that's the challenge and the call to arms for founders, create something, some product that people are clamoring for it. And that's obviously knowing that space really well and knowing your customers and knowing your people are going to use it. I think if you can get into the workflow then I think it could go really well.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Let's just embed it into the EHR workflow so that inevitably it's just there when they open it up, and there's not really any need for individual physician buy-in.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, totally.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Given what we just talked about and all these grand challenges, what are some of the types of startups that we wish that would walk through the door that we just haven't seen yet?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit.</blockquote>

### [36:44] The Potential of AI in Clinical Trials and Health Plans


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (34:51 - 37:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c03740a4-647e-4e2a-9dff-34db0140d406)




### ‚ú® Summary
AI holds significant potential to enhance clinical trials, which are crucial to healthcare and involve substantial financial investments. A mere 5-10% improvement in clinical trials could lead to substantial monetary benefits, as seen in past experiences with optimization in other sectors, like advertising. Additionally, there's a unique opportunity to develop an AI-native health plan that fundamentally rethinks payment mechanisms, risk underwriting, and patient-provider networks. Such a plan could leverage data to achieve minor cost reductions that amount to millions, while also personalizing health plans according to individual behaviors and medical histories, contrasting sharply with the current one-size-fits-all approach. This convergence of AI and healthcare paves the way for transformative advancements that could significantly impact both clinical trials and health insurance models.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit. I remember a decade or so ago, I have a acquaintance who was working for Google and they were optimizing various filters and this and that. They made it 5x better, one of the ad filters. And basically 5x was $100 million. A 5% was $100 million. And so I may be really jealous. I'm working on something in drug design or whatever to make big leaps and bounds. And small things for big cash flows can have a huge impact. Something for clinical trials could be huge. Or even just picking the order of rank ordering of clinical trials to do a better job there. Anything in that space I think would have a huge impact and we haven't seen very much. And part of it is like it's maybe not where, if you're outside of that space, you may not think to go. I think that would be my pick. Yeah. I don't know what's your pick.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Mine would be, I mean, kind of comparable in the sense of the nature of the opportunity, which is, if you were to design an AI native health plan from scratch, and basically be the way by Which healthcare payments flow, like all the problems that we talked about earlier. What are the components of a health plan? It's a payments mechanism and claims. It is a underwriting chassis in terms of how you score risk within a population. And then it's a network of who are the providers that you would actually steer patients to on the basis of understanding what kinds of services they need. And the way that those are built today, you know, you see huge opportunities to both leverage data and AI in the sense of exactly what you just talked about, where a 1% impact on the cost Structure of a health plan, or the way that you underwrite risk in a certain health plan could literally mean hundreds of millions of dollars, of either cost savings or better economics To the providers who are part of those networks. So that to me, kind of this notion of a full stack AI native health plan that takes full risk on populations and exploits all of these data sets that we're talking about to really understand At almost at an individual level. You can almost sort of imagine like an individualized health plan that is purposeful for you on the basis of your behaviors and your medical history and things like that, that is priced Entirely different than all of your employee peers who are in the same group plan versus what it is today where it's so least common denominator and like sort of everyone loses because You're trying to design for everyone in the same sort of brute force fashion.</blockquote>
