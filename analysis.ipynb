How extraordinary. And of course, we didn't realize it when we were in it so much. But the period from 45, 48, 50, to, okay, 9-11, or the election of Donald Trump, or whatever, you know, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even October 7th. How exceptional was that period where, you know, the leaders of, actually, you know, every president of the United States had kind of similar views of the world, you know, give or take Small differences. They had a view of an internationalist view of a mission to the world. And where Soviet leaders, despite believing in world revolution, and their mission to change the world, were also extremely conservative, really. And where, you know, people did respect the United Nations, that was a supranational sanctuary of something called international law, which existed because people believed it existed. And where various views became taboo in most liberal democracies, anti-Semitism, where a great liberal reformation happened with gay rights. And that another advance is the pill, the right to abortion. All these things were kind of won in this kind of period, which I call in my world history, the great liberal reformation, because it was so radical. But of course, we took it for granted. And all, of course, all of these things will have to be fought for again and are now under threat. And that exceptional period, it's hard to think of a period where anything like that really existed. You know, maybe the Roman Empire, when the Roman Empire faced the Persians and the Sasanians, there were these kind of, you know, two polar powers that really kind of kept a sort of peace. But of course, it was a much more brutal, brutal world. And of course, the rest of the world was not included in those two powers. It was really just Mediterranean and the Near East.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>So the end of this world is a sort of return to the way things have always been with massive number of powers.

But when it became a state religion with Constantine the Great, then the existence of the Jews, which had been tolerated perfectly happily under the Roman Empire, providing that they Didn't rebel politically, they were regarded as somewhat strange, believing in only one God. But because they were very ancient, they were respected. But when they resisted the new faith of the Roman Empire, newly converted, then they began to be regarded as a sort of political and religious insult, as you said. And so it's really from that period that antisemitism really started in the Byzantine official state policy, which actually became more and more anti-Jewish. And it was they who specifically, the Eastern Roman Empire, we called them the Byzantines later, but they called themselves Romans, Romaioi, they were Greek speaking, and they ruled From Constantinople. And they passed a series of increasingly stringent anti-Jewish laws, which in many ways are the sort of basis for much of anti-Semitism, the persecution of Jews, the banning of religion, That they were no longer allowed to own property, and they were not allowed onto the Temple Mount.

It's so destructive in the way that they massacred everybody in this kind of spectacular, ostentatious killing that the one modern event that reminds me of it is October the 7th. You know, more than any other, funny enough. And of course, that comes to the nature of October the 7th, which in many ways is alien to Arab and Islamic culture in the long reach of history. Where, you know, actually, when Saladin retook Jerusalem in 1187, there was no massacre. Jews were settled in the city again. And that's tradition of Islam that is utterly admirable. So what does October the 7th, it's interesting that October the 7th is more similar to a Christian storming of Jerusalem than anything else. And that comes to the nature of Islamism, of Hamas's Islamism, which is a very recent invention in Islam. And Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that was invented by El Banner in Egypt in 1928. And the other half of its peculiar genocidal racism is, of course, totally based on Nazism, on European fascism, European racism.

      "<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>I realize I've given you a very unbalanced and chaotic object to interact with here, but how do you view the eruption of anti-Semitism post-October 7th? And what do you think we do about it?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Well, I mean, I think first of all, it was just an extraordinary thing. And it was a terrible shock. And I think to see, you know, the day after or the day of, you know, this, this slaughter, this rapine, this hunt for human trophies, to see people on, on university campuses, people we Respected, celebrating was a terrifying and tragic moment. And I think, among other things, for Jewish people, just in Jewish history, I think what we saw, and events since then in the last year have confirmed this, the sort of end of the golden Age of Jewish, of tolerance for Jewish, of Jewish life in the West, and nothing less than that, which is, which is, which is a tragedy. One can now see there was a sort of golden age after World War II, after 1948, that really endured until pretty recently. And I think we didn't realize how much we had ceded power in our universities, for example, to ideologies that we really didn't understand or notice for that matter or care about that Much, and that they developed without us really understanding them or taking the trouble to judge. And so, you know, you described, I guess, the essence of one part of it, which is the progressive part where the American civil rights movement, the idea of racial identity, the history Of race, the tortured history of race and slavery in American history was applied to the Middle East, a complicated cosmopolitan, multi-faith, multi-ethnic region that really had No parallel whatsoever to the experience of African-Americans and enslavement in America at all, but which was an ideology that became a dominant stream of thought, a lens through Which to judge the world. And of course, that civil rights ideology was then was also merged with the struggle ideology of decolonization, which justified any resistance against the heirs of Western criminal Empire building in history. But to look at all this and apply all this to the creation of Israel and the creation of the Middle East requires not just misguided good intentions, but also a grotesque lack of knowledge Of what really happened. And I mean, the interesting thing is that not all of it was, as you say, traditional antisemitism in terms of things like the blood libel or the master race that the Nazis believed in. So there wasn't the sort of blatant racism that you might have found in 13th century Lincoln or 1930s Berlin. But it was very quickly, those tropes and images and traditions that were buried deep in Western culture were dug out and deployed to support an ideology that was initially probably Well-intentioned and based on ignorance. And we've now seen the merging of those two things and do so all the time from both the far right and progressive people. One of the strange inheritances of the wonderful period between the 40s and the early 21st century, when anti-Semitism was a taboo in most societies in the world. One of the great hangovers from that was a sort of formal anti-racism, in which you could say anything, providing you said you were also anti-racist. And part of that was the cult of the Holocaust, which has in many ways, in what I call a sort of terrifying dark mirroring, being used against Jewish people and against Israel. And I don't think Israel is complete, I don't think Israeli leaders have actually been wise in their overuse of this imagery either. And I think they must take some blame for extremely coarse and short-sighted overuse of these ideas as well. And they have to bear some responsibility. But overall, the merging of medieval antisemitism, 19th century and early 20th century antisemitism, with progressive decolonization, has created a sort of extraordinary new Version of anti-Semitism that is self-described as anti-racist, but is in fact highly racist. And one of the most disgusting parts of it, to me as a historian, is, as I said, the dark mirroring, the inversion of Jewish history to be used against Jews. And it started early in the 21st century with the claim that Gaza was like the Warsaw Ghetto, for example. So that strain of thinking, of course, started in the Soviet Union as a deliberate anti-American, anti-Zionist ideology in the late 50s and early 60s, and was written about in policy Papers promoted by gifted Soviet leaders like Yuri Andropov, who ran the KGB for a long time, was chairman of the KGB for a long time, and was secretly Jewish, it turns out, interestingly. And of course, that was, and from that, it was, that idea was spread in Soviet propaganda to many of the liberation movements whose successors rule places like South Africa, which is Why the ANC, for example, has adopted this view and also adopted a very pro-Russian policy in the Ukraine, for example. So that was the origin of these sort of meandering strains of thought. But the misuse of Jewish history and Jewish suffering against Jews today is a thoroughly disgusting form of this modern antisemitism. And you regularly see Jews described as sort of having massive power in the media or massive power over American society now without much challenge. So that's one part of it. So there's this myth of Jewish power, there's dark Jewish history inverted so that Palestinians become the Jews in this story, or the African Americans in this story. And of course, as you said, that requires this preposterous leap and the judgment of Jews in Western societies as a privileged elite, too privileged to suffer racism, and</blockquote>\n",

So you have this perpetual focus on the Palestinians as refugees and displaced people who should have a right of return, and you have no thought given whatsoever to the right of return Of all the Jews who are run out of Iraq and Syria and Libya and all the surrounding countries. There's no thought to that. There's no thought to the fact that in their prosecution of their wars, the Israelis hold themselves to a standard of modern combat and the minimization of collateral damage that is Not only unthinkable in the populations they're fighting, they're fighting people who use their own civilians as human shields, right? I mean, so everything is upside down with respect to the response to these differences. And inconveniently for us in describing these double standards, it begins to sound like an allegation of a widespread conspiracy theory, because, as you just said, so much of this Has been engineered consciously by Russian misinformation.</blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>Want to return to one point you raised. I realize we're getting to the end of our hour here, Simon, and it's been wonderful to get your views on everything top to bottom here. But I just want to sharpen up one point that you touched on just in passing, and you said something about the golden age for Jews having passed. Many of us in America look at Western Europe and wonder whether life for Jews there is fast becoming untenable due to the failures of assimilation of so many Muslim immigrants who, in What proportion that remains to be seen, but in a proportion that is both and dangerous, seem committed to some form of Islamist slash jihadist way of life there. And, you know, out of that falls a fairly murderous anti-Semitism. What's your view of the prospects for Judaism in Europe at this point? Is there another diaspora in the making?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Do you know, I think that Jews will have a future in the liberal democracies. And I think that if you look at societies like Britain, for example, the divisions are hugely exaggerated between different ethnic groups, different religions in Britain. I mean, when you walk the streets of London, you see such an amazing cosmopolitan world. And there is something to be said for that argument that these sort of stresses most intensify when real mixing and real cosmopolitanism is actually thriving in a way. So I think, I don't feel as that, you know, we're living on the side, on the edge of a volcano.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>But what I do feel is- And can you say that, are you including in that analysis all the countries in Western Europe, like France and Belgium and- All of them have followed slightly different</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>Policies in creating, and some of them have created, you more divided societies than we have in Britain. And, you know, what we saw in Amsterdam, for example, the other day, was extremely alarming. And when one looks at that event, as so often in our conversation tonight or today, you know, you have to be able to hold two thoughts in your own mind. I mean, in Amsterdam, for example, you have to be able to recognize that, first of all, some Israeli soccer hooligans, like soccer hooligans everywhere, like the factions that supported The chariot teams in ancient Constantinople. Some of them are complete thugs. And some of them acted in a thuggish way and did tear down Palestinian flags and what have you. What happened the next day was equally undeniably an organized pogrom, organized on social media and hunting Jews through the streets of Amsterdam. And both these things can be true and were true. And that does reflect a crisis in Dutch society that I'm not an expert on. And so I would be careful what I said about it, but it does seem to reflect some sort of crisis in society. And I just go back to what I said, and this is what we've, we in civil society now have a big task in America and in the Western world. One thing is not to tolerate views that are based on twisted ideologies in our institutions. We've let them get this far. And if necessary, civil society must ultimately gather itself and withdraw support, even from great institutions, be it Harvard or whatever, even the BBC, if they're incapable of Separating themselves from really toxic distortions and forms of racism. But at the same time, we've got to give courage to our political leadership, not to be bullied by these relatively small groups of people. And I think, you know, there's nothing wrong if there are a few streets of people who have obnoxious views in a Western city. That shouldn't be allowed to intimidate any section of society or an elected leadership of political leaders we have elected in order to keep us safe. After all, that's the entire point of why states were formed, why we elect people in the first place. If they can't do that, then they're not doing their job. But the right of small groups of people in Western societies to hold appallingly views. They have every right to hold those views, but not to intimidate others. And that's where the line comes. And, you know, I just go back to saying that our societies need to regain their confidence in themselves. Our leaders need to be, we need to reward leaders who take these people on and who don't tolerate utterly intolerant racist views in any part of society, be wherever it is, then there's No problem. Because the number of people who hold these views are actually very small. Even in all communities, there are very, very small minority. But of course, as always happens in history, when it looks at revolutions, revolutions and radical changes made by very small groups of dedicated vanguardists. As Lenin wrote about in What Is To Be Done, I think in 1903 or 1904, whenever he wrote it, he spotted the essence of political power is dedicated small groups. And that's what's happened. Small groups of people that can produce big crowds in our streets.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Harris</b><br/><br/>That really does cut both ways. I mean, I hear, I'm comforted by the knowledge that it's such a small group of people who are very loud. And yet, when you look at instances in history, like the Russian Revolution and Lenin's part in it, you can see what very small committed groups of people can accomplish when everyone Else is silent.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Simon Seabag Montefiore</b><br/><br/>And that brings us back to the fact that, but yes, the golden era of Jewish life, when the whole of society would unite immediately to stop these sort of threats is over. And I think that it's alarmist to say we're in the 1930s. I mean, I think that we, I feel that we're more like going to have to exist in a world rather like the sort of late 19th century, where our safety is assured most of the time. But there are dangerous incidents which are very frightening, and we have to be ready for those. But those are things that were unthinkable in the golden age of Judaism and of Jewry. And that tragically died on October the 7th and 8th. But I do think civil society, at some point, something will happen and civil society will empower politicians and empower its donors, its own activists, to</blockquote>\n",

    "Empathy is the ability to understand and articulate the perspective of others without necessarily agreeing or liking them. It requires straight understanding of where they're coming from, without the need for agreement. Empathy can be a powerful tool as it allows you to connect with and understand anyone, even if you do not sympathize or agree with them. It is important to show that you understand someone's perspective, regardless of your own views, in order to have a meaningful conversation and potentially bridge gaps of understanding.\n",

    "<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric. The people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people. We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly. And I would say to them, you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that are anti-Islamic and they shake their head and go, yeah. And that'd be the start of the conversation. That's empathy. You believe this to be the case. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed. But I showed them that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs. I was so unafraid of them that I was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because I would say that and then I'd shut up and let them react. And I never had to say, here's why you're wrong. I never gave my point of view. Every single one of them are testified. That's empathy, not agreeing where the other side is coming from.</blockquote>\n",

Microsoft was a monopoly, incredibly advantaged. It had just been horribly mismanaged for years. All he had to do to start winning was stop doing really, really dumb things. And that's an incredible place to be. You know, America, like we're the greatest country.

       "   'transcript_cleaned_of_md_and_html_tags': \"So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric. The people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people. We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly. And I would say to them, you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that are anti-Islamic and they shake their head and go, yeah. And that'd be the start of the conversation. That's empathy. You believe this to be the case. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed. But I showed them that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs. I was so unafraid of them that I was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because I would say that and then I'd shut up and let them react. And I never had to say, here's why you're wrong. I never gave my point of view. Every single one of them are testified. That's empathy, not agreeing where the other side is coming from.\",\n",

And I did that kind of very deliberately because I view that I\\'m up against a religion, the sort of AI risk, fear religion. So, but I am not myself religious, you know, lowercase, are religious in the sense of, you know, I\\'m not a utopian. I\\'m very much a, yeah, I\\'m an adherent to what Thomas O\\'Call, the constrained vision, not the unconstrained vision. So I live, I live in a world of practicalities and trade-offs. And so, yeah, I am actually not utopian. Look, having said that, building on what you\\'ve already said, like intelligence, if there is a lever for human progress across many thousands of domains simultaneously, it is intelligence And we just, we know that because we have thousands of years of experience seeing that play out. The thing I would add to, I thought you made that case very well, the thing I would add to the case you made about the positive virtues of intelligence in human life is that the way you described It, at least the way I heard it was more focused on like the social societal wide benefits of intelligence, for example, cures for diseases and so forth. That is true. And I agree with all that. There are also individual level benefits of intelligence, right? At the level of an individual, even if you\\'re not the scientist who invented secure for cancer, at an individual level, if you are smarter, you have better life welfare outcomes on almost Every metric that we know how to measure everything from how long you live, how healthy you\\'ll be, how much education you\\'ll achieve, career success, the success of your children. By the way, your ability to solve problems, your ability to deal with conflict, smarter people are less violent, smarter people are less bigoted. And so there\\'s this very broad pattern of human behavior where basically more intelligence, just simply at the individual level, at least to better outcomes. And so the sort of most utopian I\\'m willing to get is sort of this potential, which I think is very real right now. It\\'s already started where you basically just say, look, human beings from here on out are going to have an augmentation and the augmentation is going to be in the long tradition of augmentations Like everything from eyeglasses to shoes to work processors to search engines. But now the augmentation is intelligence. And that augmented intelligence capability is going to let them capture</blockquote>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n### [38:25] Untitled\\n\\n\\n[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (37:14 - 38:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d0f6d2a6-da1f-4b99-b48c-f7f7cd4fa4cc)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### üìö Transcript\\n<details>\\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\\n<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So a couple of things. So one is like, look, I don\\'t know, you\\'re kind of making my point for me. So evolution and intelligent design, as you well know, are two totally different things. And so we are evolved, and of course we\\'re not just evolved to, we are evolved to have kids. And by the way, when somebody chooses to not have kids, I would argue that is also evolution working. People are opting out of the gene pool, fair enough. Evolution does not guarantee a perfect result. It basically just is a mechanism up for an aggregate. But let me get to the point. So we are evolved. We have conflict wired into us. We have conflict and strife and like that. Look, in four billion years of battles to the death at the individual and then ultimately the societal level to get to where we are like that, we just, we fight at the drop of a hat. We all do, everybody does. And hopefully these days we fight verbally like we are now and not physically. But we do. And like the machine is, it\\'s intelligent. It\\'s a process of intelligent design. It\\'s the opposite of evolution. These machines are being designed by us. If they design future versions of itself, they\\'ll be intelligently designing themselves. It\\'s just a completely different path of a completely different mechanism. And so the idea that therefore conflict is wired in at the same level that it is through evolution, I just like there\\'s no reason to expect that to be the case.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But it\\'s not again, well, let me just give you back this picture with a slightly different framing and see how you react to</blockquote>\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n---'}]"
