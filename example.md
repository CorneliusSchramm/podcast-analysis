### [16:42] Articulate the Perspective of Others


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (15:25 - 18:52)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a706cfd-8c9f-4dd9-ac73-a0880c9fdc1a)




### ‚ú® Summary
Empathy is the ability to understand and articulate the perspective of others without necessarily agreeing or liking them. It requires straight understanding of where they're coming from, without the need for agreement. Empathy can be a powerful tool as it allows you to connect with and understand anyone, even if you do not sympathize or agree with them. It is important to show that you understand someone's perspective, regardless of your own views, in order to have a meaningful conversation and potentially bridge gaps of understanding.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So Bob's definition of empathy said not agreeing or even liking the other side. Don't even got to like them. Don't got to agree with them. Just straight understanding where they're coming from and articulating it, which requires no agreement whatsoever. That becomes a very powerful tool, like ridiculously powerful. And if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included, you can be empathic with anybody. I was thinking about this when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you because you use the word empathy a lot. Putin. I can be empathic with Putin. Easy. It's easy. I don't agree with where he's coming from. I don't agree with his methodology. Only on the Ukraine-Russian war, I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia that said, Russia's basically Europe's gas station. And I thought, all right. So if you're in charge and the way you feed your people is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit, the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels. But that's how you feed your people. If you don't come up with an answer to that, the people that you've taken a responsibility for are going to die alone in the cold and the dark. They're going to freeze and they're going to die. All right. So that doesn't mean that I agree with where he's coming from or any of his means. But where is, how does this guy see things? It is a distorted word. You're never going to get through to somebody like that in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them you understand where they're coming from, whether or not you agree. In the early 90s, last century, I'm a last century guy. I'm an old dude. Refer to myself as a last century guy, also a deeply flawed human. So terrorist case, New York City, civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals. That's a very bad idea. It was always bad. The FBI was always against it. I'm getting ready, we have Muslims testifying in open court against the legitimate Muslim cleric, the guy that was on trial had the credentials as a legitimate Muslim cleric. The people that were testifying against him didn't think he should be advocating murder of innocent people. We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly. And I would say to them, you believe that there's been a succession of American governments for the last 200 years that are anti-Islamic and they shake their head and go, yeah. And that'd be the start of the conversation. That's empathy. You believe this to be the case. I never said I agreed. I never said I disagreed. But I showed them that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs. I was so unafraid of them that I was willing to just state them and not disagree or contradict because I would say that and then I'd shut up and let them react. And I never had to say, here's why you're wrong. I never gave my point of view. Every single one of them are testified. That's empathy, not agreeing where the other side is coming from.</blockquote>

### [06:16] America's Untapped Potential


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (04:43 - 06:15)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa8a6dd3-4d74-4136-b86f-c117301884e5)


**America's Untapped Potential**

- America, like Microsoft under Ballmer, has immense potential but has been mismanaged.
- By simply stopping "really, really dumb things" like excessive regulations, America can unlock significant growth.
- This is analogous to Satya Nadella's turnaround of Microsoft, which involved ceasing counterproductive practices.
- A key area for improvement is reducing excessive regulations that hinder development.
-  This has led to too many administrators and unnecessary complexities, exemplified by the inefficient allocation of funds for rural broadband and EV chargers under the Harris administration.

<blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>So if they execute unstated plans and there are some of the world's greatest execution machines involved, Elon generally does what he says he's going to do. Like, this is going to be awesome for America, for markets, for the world. And the analogy I keep coming back to is Satya Nadella taking over as CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft was a monopoly, incredibly advantaged. It had just been horribly mismanaged for years. All he had to do to start winning was stop doing really, really dumb things. And that's an incredible place to be. You know, America, like we're the greatest country. You know, we've got, you know, oceans on two sides, peaceful neighbors, incredible natural resources, you know, completely, you know, can produce our own food and energy, like in Many ways, most privileged country on earth. But sometimes with great privilege comes great, like stupidity. And California, to me, would be a leading example of that. Most, in many ways, most privileged state in America, and has printed it away with bad policies. And I do think one thing that everyone of all political stripes agrees on is there are too many regulations that result in far too many administrators, far too much complexity, and an Inability to build things in America.

**Nuclear Energy Advocacy**

- Advocate for increased nuclear energy development.
- It's the most environmentally friendly energy source, even better than solar.

**Bitcoin vs. USD**

- David Friedberg agrees with Gavin Baker that Bitcoin is a potential threat to the US dollar.
- He points out the irony of Trump supporting Bitcoin while simultaneously opposing other alternative currencies.
- Friedberg believes that eventually, the US government will recognize Bitcoin as a threat.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Well, I definitely concur with Gavin. I think Bitcoin fundamentally is meant to be, supposed to be, ultimately will become a real threat to the US dollar. And it's kind of ironic that Trump had this declaration this week that he's going to put 100% tariff on all these BRICS nations that try to participate in an alternative currency to the US dollar, the greatest currency on earth, when he literally turns around and then says, we're going to support Bitcoin. It felt like the biggest irony of the week to me, because I do think Bitcoin is the big threat to the US dollar. And I do think that at some point, whether it's this administration or the next, they're going to wake up to that fact. And maybe the Bitcoin does, you know, the network state concept does emerge. And that's where we end up. But I do think we want to have and are going to have a strong federal government in the United States for quite some time, that's going to play an important role in everyone's lives here. And I don't know if you can really just say, let the dollar, you know, be supplanted by Bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to be a more of a safe haven asset and that seems to be the trade that it's store it should be kind of sort of value and alternative it's just going to take over gold what do you Think you think um the</blockquote>

**Regulating Private Investments**

- If private companies were made available to ordinary investors like public companies, regulatory changes would be required.
- Private companies currently adhere to lower disclosure and reporting standards compared to their public counterparts.
- Public companies are subject to stricter standards for a reason, concerning financial transparency and data integrity.

**Restricting China's Access to Advanced Compute**

- The US is restricting China's access to advanced computing and networking technology, like a "sophons" from the sci-fi novel *The Three-Body Problem*.
- Despite this, China remains close behind the US in AI development.
- New chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom in the coming year might make it impossible for China to keep up.

Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Joe Lonsdale</b><br/><br/>That's a great way to say it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>I have been really impressed with, um, some of the Chinese models that have come out. And I think the risk to this strategy is necessity is the mother of invention. And despite this handicap, they're managing to stay just behind the leading edge of America, which is amazing. But, you know, NVIDIA's Blackwell chip comes out next year. You're going to have new chips from AMD, new A6 from Broadcom. And I think at that point, it is not going to be possible for them to keep up anymore.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jason Calacanis</b><br/><br/>So that's actually positive regulation and great, in your mind, foreign policy.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>It is very aggressive foreign policy yeah clearly you know that could have lots of unforeseen consequences yeah what do you think about the the rare earth trade restrictions</blockquote>

**New Scaling Laws in AI**

- Grok 3's large GPU cluster will provide data on whether scaling laws are breaking down or holding as models grow.
- There's a new scaling axis called 'test time compute' or 'inference scaling'.
-  Giving models more time to think about complex questions dramatically improves performance, similar to how humans tackle problems.

<blockquote><b>Gavin Baker</b><br/><br/>The other question you raise, David, is very interesting. And by the way, we should note there is now a new axis of scaling. Some people call it test time compute. Some people call it inference scaling. And basically the way this works, you just think of these models as human. The more you speak to one of these models, the way you'd speak to your 17-year going off to take the SAT, the better it will do for you. As a human, if I ask you, David, what's two plus two, four flashes in your mind right away. If I ask you to, you know, unify a grand unified theory of physics that accounts for both quantum mechanics and relativistic physics, you will think for a lot longer. We have been, yeah, nobody knows. We have been giving these models the same amount of time to think no matter how complicated the question was. What we've now learned is if you let them think for longer about more complex questions, test time compute, you can dramatically improve their IQ. So we're just at the beginning of this new scaling law. But I think the question you raise on ROI is very good.</blockquote>

**Health Insurance Business**

- United Healthcare's medical loss ratio is ~85%, meaning they pay out 85 cents of every dollar collected in insurance premiums for claims.
- Health insurance, alongside auto insurance, is one of the most challenging businesses due to constant payouts and difficulty managing losses.
- There's a delicate balance between keeping health insurance affordable and managing the cost of medical claims. If all claims were paid, premiums would rise, making insurance unaffordable.

<blockquote><b>David Friedberg</b><br/><br/>Yeah. United Healthcare's medical loss ratio is about 85%. So 85 cents of it. So 85 cents of every dollar they collect an insurance premium, they're paying out in claims. If you guys want to look at what the most egregious insurance industry in the world is, it's title insurance. And I'll give you the list of the rest. Travel insurance is pretty bad. They pay out like nothing. You were in the insurance business for a bit there. Yeah. Like, I mean, you know, health insurance is the hardest, one of the hardest besides auto insurance businesses to be in. You're paying out constantly. And there is a very difficult kind of process of managing losses, because the number of claims that comes in, it's very easy to suddenly pay everything out. And then your premium goes up, and then people can't afford the health insurance. So you're striking this balance of making health insurance affordable against the cost of medical claims.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. AI reflects the flaws of existing healthcare systems, with its effectiveness directly tied to the human-written rules it automates, highlighting the need for systemic improvements.
2. Denial rates in healthcare are influenced by the speed of AI executing flawed processes, rather than the technology itself, emphasizing the importance of redesigning business models.
3. To improve healthcare workflows for professionals, new tools must be integrated seamlessly into existing systems like electronic health records to enhance adoption and reduce burden.
4. Startups should focus on creating AI-driven products that resonate with healthcare providers, taking into account their insights and the industry's demands to encourage widespread use.
5. AI has considerable potential in enhancing clinical trials, where even small improvements can lead to significant financial benefits, drawing parallels to optimization successes in advertising.
6. There is a unique opportunity to design AI-native health plans that rethink payment mechanisms and risk underwriting, aiming for personalization rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

In a value-based care world, AI serves as a catalyst for improvement, yet its effectiveness directly depends on the existing human-written rules it automates. Current complaints regarding increased denial rates stem from the speed of AI in executing flawed rules, not from the technology itself. The root issue lies within the human-designed processes, and a shift to new business models provides an opportunity to address and rectify these systemic flaws, promoting more logical spend control.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It's fun to think that in a fee-for world, AI is nice, but maybe actually goes against what you want. In a value-based care world, actually AI is the catalyst. If you can do things better, you can see the value.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's actually funny, the example that that reminds me of is how the AI are getting sued right now. There's a bunch of major national payers who are using AI algorithms to automate prior authorization. And so all they're doing is taking the rules that humans wrote, that humans were executing slowly, and doing it faster. And so now all of a sudden, everyone is complaining, oh, everything, like the denial rate is going up, but it's actually not the rate of denial is not going up, it's the speed with which The denials are happening that's going up. Don't blame the technology, the humans who actually wrote the rules and you're just seeing kind of an exacerbated version of it. We're going to deal with a lot of that of kind of the finger pointing at the technology where it's actually just implementing the broken system underneath it. And that's why this kind of move to like new business models gives you the opportunity to clean that up and start with logical ways to control spend.</blockquote>

### [35:24] Integrate to Innovate


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (33:55 - 35:22)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e878efde-9e05-46a7-bd27-f24646edb1ec)




### ‚ú® Summary
To enhance the workflow for healthcare professionals, especially doctors, new tools must be designed to be perceived as beneficial rather than burdensome. This can be achieved by integrating solutions directly into existing systems like electronic health records (EHR), eliminating the need for individual physician buy-in. Startups should focus on creating products that are eagerly adopted by healthcare providers, tapping into their understanding of the industry and user needs. Additionally, there is significant potential for AI-driven innovations in clinical trials. By improving the efficiency of clinical trials, which are crucial in healthcare and highly funded, even a modest enhancement in their performance can yield substantial returns, making this sector ripe for development.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I think so. The whole problem with co-pilots is, can you work it in a way that goes in the doctor workflow where they view it as a benefit, not a nuisance. It's not some alert or whatever. It's like something where they are going to it. If you can do that, and maybe we've seen this with scribes and so on, something where doctors are like, hell yeah, I want this. This is great. If we can create that, and maybe that's the challenge and the call to arms for founders, create something, some product that people are clamoring for it. And that's obviously knowing that space really well and knowing your customers and knowing your people are going to use it. I think if you can get into the workflow then I think it could go really well.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Let's just embed it into the EHR workflow so that inevitably it's just there when they open it up, and there's not really any need for individual physician buy-in.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, totally.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Given what we just talked about and all these grand challenges, what are some of the types of startups that we wish that would walk through the door that we just haven't seen yet?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit.</blockquote>

### [36:44] The Potential of AI in Clinical Trials and Health Plans


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (34:51 - 37:36)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c03740a4-647e-4e2a-9dff-34db0140d406)




### ‚ú® Summary
AI holds significant potential to enhance clinical trials, which are crucial to healthcare and involve substantial financial investments. A mere 5-10% improvement in clinical trials could lead to substantial monetary benefits, as seen in past experiences with optimization in other sectors, like advertising. Additionally, there's a unique opportunity to develop an AI-native health plan that fundamentally rethinks payment mechanisms, risk underwriting, and patient-provider networks. Such a plan could leverage data to achieve minor cost reductions that amount to millions, while also personalizing health plans according to individual behaviors and medical histories, contrasting sharply with the current one-size-fits-all approach. This convergence of AI and healthcare paves the way for transformative advancements that could significantly impact both clinical trials and health insurance models.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One area that I've been waiting for, and I think it's maybe a little early, maybe not, maybe just right at the right time, is something where clinical trials can be addressed with AI. And this is where it's a confluence of a couple of things. One is clinical trials are obviously so important. We talked about real world and the ongoing clinical trials as a part of healthcare. But then finally, clinical trials, because so much money flows through it, you could improve them 5% or 10%. It's not like you have to do something heroic to be able to not have to 10 exit or 100 exit. I remember a decade or so ago, I have a acquaintance who was working for Google and they were optimizing various filters and this and that. They made it 5x better, one of the ad filters. And basically 5x was $100 million. A 5% was $100 million. And so I may be really jealous. I'm working on something in drug design or whatever to make big leaps and bounds. And small things for big cash flows can have a huge impact. Something for clinical trials could be huge. Or even just picking the order of rank ordering of clinical trials to do a better job there. Anything in that space I think would have a huge impact and we haven't seen very much. And part of it is like it's maybe not where, if you're outside of that space, you may not think to go. I think that would be my pick. Yeah. I don't know what's your pick.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Mine would be, I mean, kind of comparable in the sense of the nature of the opportunity, which is, if you were to design an AI native health plan from scratch, and basically be the way by Which healthcare payments flow, like all the problems that we talked about earlier. What are the components of a health plan? It's a payments mechanism and claims. It is a underwriting chassis in terms of how you score risk within a population. And then it's a network of who are the providers that you would actually steer patients to on the basis of understanding what kinds of services they need. And the way that those are built today, you know, you see huge opportunities to both leverage data and AI in the sense of exactly what you just talked about, where a 1% impact on the cost Structure of a health plan, or the way that you underwrite risk in a certain health plan could literally mean hundreds of millions of dollars, of either cost savings or better economics To the providers who are part of those networks. So that to me, kind of this notion of a full stack AI native health plan that takes full risk on populations and exploits all of these data sets that we're talking about to really understand At almost at an individual level. You can almost sort of imagine like an individualized health plan that is purposeful for you on the basis of your behaviors and your medical history and things like that, that is priced Entirely different than all of your employee peers who are in the same group plan versus what it is today where it's so least common denominator and like sort of everyone loses because You're trying to design for everyone in the same sort of brute force fashion.</blockquote>
