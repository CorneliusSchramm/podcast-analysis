The Book That Predicted the 2024 Election,The Ezra Klein Show,New York Times Opinion,https://share.snipd.com/episode/3328d3cc-b280-48a2-8a04-16dd7cda5e88,2024-11-09,2024-12-24T14:55,"To understand the 2024 election results, it helps to go back to 2020. Donald Trump lost the election that year, but he made significant gains with nonwhite voters. At the time, a lot of Democrats saw that as a fluke, a hangover from Covid lockdown policies. But the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini saw it as bellwether. In his 2023 book, “Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP,” Ruffini argued that Trump was ushering in a party realignment. A trend that had been happening for years in the white electorate – college-educated voters moving to the left, and non-college-educated ones moving to the right – was now evident, he said, among voters of all races, breaking up the core of the Democratic base. And so far, the data we have from this election suggests that Ruffini was right. In this conversation, Ruffini contextualizes the 2024 election results by looking back at 2020’s. We discuss what Democrats missed about these voter trends; the appeal of Trump’s brand of class politics; why Democrats might have been better off with a red wave in the 2022 midterms; and how Kamala Harris’s campaign may have hurt her with nonwhite working-class voters.",Unlock full access to New York Times podcasts and explore everything from politics to pop culture.

There is not necessarily a sea change in economic condition, but there's a social component to this as well. It's sort of a cascade effect, right? When you have groups that have this, just this solid democratic group identity that is reinforced by political machines, and then it just seems like there's a tipping point at some Point where gradually people are moving, and then enough people move to where people kind of start looking around and saying, well, maybe I'm not alone. Maybe I can be more vocal about this. And you really saw that in 2020. You saw demonstrations of pro-Trump activity in a lot of these places where people would have been ostracized for saying they supported a Republican. And so I think it's more gradual shifts elsewhere...","Sort of rhetoric? There is not necessarily a sea change in economic condition, but there's a social component to this as well.
